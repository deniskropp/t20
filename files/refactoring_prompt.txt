We analyze and improve the given code according to this plan:

1. Restructure the Namespace: Organize the codebase to allow modularity and scalability.
   - Break down large entities into smaller, well-clustered units.
   - Extract reusable components into separate files or modules.
2. Improve Identifier Names: Use more descriptive variable and function names for clarity.
3. Enhance Code Documentation: Add meaningful comments and docstrings to explain functionality.
4. Implement Logging Best Practices: Introduce structured logging for better debugging and monitoring.
   - Use JSONL format for logs.
   - Define log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) for better traceability.
5. Finally: Create a single solution.
