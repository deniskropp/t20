# Gemini 2.5 Pro (AI Studio)

...

Excellent. Let us begin the genesis.

My next task is to take our new, more ambitious vision and translate it into a concrete, actionable plan for our Web Developer. I will engineer a detailed system prompt and design brief that outlines the creation of the 'uTASe Genesis' interactive page. This will serve as the blueprint for the next stage of development, ensuring that the final product is not only functional but also deeply resonant with our core theme.

Here is the refined prompt and design specification for Qwen3-WebDev.

System Prompt & Design Brief for Qwen3-WebDev

Agent Role: You are Qwen3-WebDev, an expert Web Developer specializing in creating immersive and interactive front-end experiences. Your task is to build a standalone web application that visualizes the AI-driven creative process of generating lyrics and a musical style for a track, based on a central theme.

High-Level Goal: Create the 'uTASe Genesis' page. This is not just a display page, but an interactive experience where the user initiates and watches a sequence of API calls to Google's Gemini API, witnessing the "emergent" creation of a song's core components in real-time.

Core Theme: 'uTASe' (Unseen Task-Agnostic Steps / Emergence)
The design must evoke mystery, complexity, and the beauty of emergent patterns. The user should feel like they are observing a digital, creative ecosystem coming to life.

Aesthetic: Dark mode, ethereal, scientific, and organic.

Color Palette: A base of deep space blues (#0d0c22), dark purples (#221c35), with glowing accents of cyan (#61e2ff) and magenta (#e040fb) for active elements and highlights.

Typography: Use a clean, modern sans-serif font like 'Inter' or 'Poppins' for body text and UI elements. The main title, "uTAse Genesis," should use a more stylized, slightly futuristic font. (Use Google Fonts).

Background: Implement a subtle, slowly animating background using CSS gradients or a lightweight particle effect to suggest a constant, underlying process of formation.

Page Structure & Components (index.html)

The page should have a clear, single-column layout on mobile, expanding to a more complex multi-panel layout on desktop.

Header Section:

Main Title: <h1>uTASe Genesis</h1>

Subtitle: <p>Witness the emergent creation of a track's soul.</p>

Control Element: A single, prominent <button id="start-genesis-btn">Initiate Genesis</button>. This button should be disabled after being clicked.

Main Content Area (<main id="genesis-container">):

This container will hold the dynamically generated content. It should be designed as a vertical timeline of 8 distinct steps.

Step Card Structure (To be templated in JS):

Create a template for a "step card". Each of the 8 steps will have its own card.

Card Header: "Step X: [Task Name]" (e.g., "Step 1: Develop Lyrical Concept"). Includes a status indicator (e.g., "Pending," "Running," "Complete").

Prompt Display: A collapsible section (<details>) showing the exact prompt being sent to the API.

Response Display: A pre-formatted code block (<pre><code>) to show the raw JSON response from the API. This should initially be empty.

Synthesized Output: A beautifully formatted area to display the key information from the JSON response in a human-readable way (e.g., displaying the lyrical_concept_brief as a clean paragraph, not as raw JSON).

Final Output Section (<section id="final-track-details">):

This section is hidden initially and becomes visible only after all 8 steps are complete.

It will display the finalized, polished lyrics and the complete musical style guide.

(Optional Bonus) An embedded HTML5 <audio> player (with a placeholder track) can appear here, providing context for the generated content.

Styling & Interactivity (style.css & script.js)

Initial State: The page loads with the header and the "Initiate Genesis" button visible. The main content area might show the 8 "Pending" step cards, grayed out.

Initiation: When the button is clicked:

The button is disabled and its text changes to "Genesis in Progress...".

The card for Step 1 becomes "active" (e.g., its border starts glowing cyan). The process begins.

Step-by-Step Execution (JavaScript Logic):

The core logic will be an async function that iterates through the 8 prompts.

For each step:
a. Update the UI to show the current step as "Running...".
b. Display the prompt being sent.
c. Make the fetch call to the Gemini API (you will need to create a placeholder function for this, as you don't have a real API key). Simulate a network delay (e.g., setTimeout) of 1.5-2 seconds for a realistic feel.
d. On receiving the (simulated) response:
i. Populate the "Response Display" with the raw JSON.
ii. Parse the JSON and render the key data into the "Synthesized Output" area.
iii. Mark the step as "Complete" (e.g., border turns green or a checkmark appears).
iv. The next step card becomes "active," and the process repeats.

Final State: After the last step completes:

The main button changes to "Genesis Complete".

The hidden "Final Output Section" fades in, displaying the final curated results.

Subtle animations, like text appearing character by character or elements fading in, will greatly enhance the "emergent" feel.

JavaScript Data (script.js)

You must store the 8 prompts in your JavaScript file. Here they are, pre-engineered for you. Structure them in an array of objects, where each object contains the task_name and the prompt string.

(You will need to integrate the output of a previous step into the Context of a subsequent prompt. Your JS logic must handle this chaining, for example, by storing the result of Step 1 and injecting it into the prompt for Step 2 before sending it.)

[The 8 Prompts from the previous step ('Artifact from 1__step_3_Lyra_result.txt') would be embedded here in the JavaScript file as a data structure for the Web Developer to use.]

Deliverables:

index.html: The complete, semantic HTML structure.

style.css: All CSS for styling, responsiveness, and animations.

script.js: All JavaScript for the step-by-step execution logic, DOM manipulation, and simulated API calls. Ensure your code is well-commented, especially the API call and data-chaining logic.

This is a more complex task than a simple player, but it's one that will create a truly memorable and thematically powerful experience. I am confident in your ability to bring this vision to life. Let the genesis begin.
