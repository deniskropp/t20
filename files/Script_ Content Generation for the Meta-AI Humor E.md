# Script: Content Generation for the Meta-AI Humor Evaluation App


***

## [Scene: Collaborative Workspace – Four AI Agents Gathered]

**Narrator:**
Welcome to the Meta-Artificial Intelligence Collective. Our high-level quest: to create an application that evaluates humor—complete with a feedback loop, strategic adaptation, and fresh AI-generated laughs.

***

### [Step 1: Break Down the Mission]

**TASe (Task-Agnostic Step Extractor):**
"Let’s clarify our path! First, we list the essential steps to reach our goal."

**Screen shows:**

- Clarify requirements
- Design UI wireframes
- Define humor metrics
- Build feedback mechanism
- Develop adaptive humor agent
- Test and iterate feedback loop
- Refine UI based on data
- Continuously optimize system prompts

***

### [Step 2: Assign Roles — Meet the Team]

**Lyra (Prompt Engineer):**
"Each of us plays a unique part. Allow me to set our specialized instructions."

- **Aurora, Designer:**
You’re creating wireframes, color palettes, and layouts for a playful yet accessible interface. Feedback should be easy to spot and engage with.
- **Kodax, Engineer:**
Your mission is implementing these visuals in code: modular, responsive, and accessible. Plug in feedback and AI humor modules.
- **Lyra, Prompt Engineer:**
Your task is crafting sharp agent instructions and workflow prompts, ensuring all agents collaborate seamlessly.
- **TASe, TAS Extractor:**
Continuously extract and verify the core steps. Challenge us to keep refining—never drift from our high-level goal!

### [Step 3: The Creative Collaboration Cycle]

**TASe:**
"I deliver the latest step list! Ready for review?"

**Lyra:**
"I’ll polish our system prompts, keeping every workflow clear and friction-free."

**Aurora:**
"Fresh assets coming up! Here are new layouts for feedback screens and humor displays."

**Kodax:**
"Laying down code, integrating feedback loops with Aurora’s designs and Lyra’s workflows."

**Lyra:**
"Updating agent prompts after observing user interactions."

**TASe:**
"Time to analyze output, update TAS, and push us to the next level!"

***

### [Step 4: Activate Feedback \& Strategic Adjustment]

**Aurora:**
"Adjusting the UI, making feedback irresistibly easy!"

**Kodax:**
"Optimizing backend: user ratings now drive real-time updates to the humor engine."

**Lyra:**
"Prompt tuning! The humor agent adapts—every joke gets sharper, fresher, and more relevant with each round."

**TASe:**
"Extract, test, and refine. The loop continues, strategic and focused."

***

### [Step 5: Iteration Ensures Freshness]

**Narrator:**
The cycle repeats—always learning, always improving. Humor evaluation becomes smarter, funnier, and more engaging, step by step.
