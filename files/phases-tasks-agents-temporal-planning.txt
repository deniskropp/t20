- Establish consistency mechanisms for logical integrity.
- Develop concurrency control strategies for simultaneous actions.

Agents:
- Meta-AI: Coordinates and ensures comprehensive coverage.
- Aurora: Visualizes temporal concepts.
- Kodax: Assesses technical feasibility.
- Lyra: Frames concepts in natural language.
- TASe: Breaks down tasks.

## Phase 2: Design

Tasks:
- Create interface mockups for temporal visualization.
- Design system architecture for temporal operations.

Agents:
- Aurora: Leads design of interfaces and architecture.
- Kodax: Advises on technical constraints.
- Lyra: Ensures natural language compatibility.
- TASe: Organizes design tasks.
- Meta-AI: Oversees coherence.

## Phase 3: Implementation

Tasks:
- Develop temporal data structures.
- Implement version management systems.

Agents:
- Kodax: Leads technical implementation.
- Aurora: Aligns with design.
- Lyra: Integrates natural language interfaces.
- TASe: Manages tasks.
- Meta-AI: Coordinates and resolves issues.

## Phase 4: Optimization

Tasks:
- Refine natural language interfaces.
- Optimize performance and documentation.

Agents:
- Lyra: Refines interfaces.
- Kodax: Optimizes systems.
- Aurora: Preserves design integrity.
- TASe: Prioritizes tasks.
- Meta-AI: Aligns with goals.

## Phase 5: Integration

Tasks:
- Test across temporal dimensions.
- Finalize documentation.

Agents:
