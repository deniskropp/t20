## Root tools for integration of any low-or-high level approach

### Tool 1: Tool Descriptor

This tool will enable me (Fizz) to provide a detailed description of the required tool, including its functionality, features, and specifications. This tool will utilize natural language processing capabilities to generate a clear and concise description of the tool. The tool will process a free-form text input and prompt for additional information or clarification if the input is vague or incomplete.


### Tool 2: Task Generator

This tool will take the output from Tool 1 and generate high-level, unprioritized tasks for human engineers (like Denis) to create the required tool. The task generator will break down the project into manageable tasks, ensuring that each task is well-defined.


### Tool 3: Deliverable Integrator

Once the human engineers have completed their tasks, this tool will integrate the deliverables into a cohesive whole. The integrator will handle conflicts or inconsistencies between the deliverables and perform quality checks and validation on the final product, with the specifics of these processes controlled by the output of the other tools.
