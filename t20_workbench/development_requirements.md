# Development Requirements

Based on the analysis of the T20 Workbench, the following development requirements have been identified to address technical debt, improve scalability, and incorporate new features.

## I. Core System Enhancements

1.  **Requirement ID:** `CORE-001`
    **Title:** Centralize Configuration Management
    **Description:** Consolidate all environment-specific paths, LLM API keys, and other configurable parameters into a centralized configuration system. The `ConfigManager` should be extended to manage all such settings, replacing hardcoded values throughout the application.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.5 (Architecture Analysis - Configuration Management), T-00.6 (Technical Debt - Hardcoded Paths).
    **Priority:** High
    **Estimated Effort:** Medium

2.  **Requirement ID:** `CORE-002`
    **Title:** Implement Comprehensive Automated Testing
    **Description:** Introduce a robust testing framework (e.g., pytest) and develop a comprehensive test suite covering unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests for core modules, agent interactions, and UI components.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.6 (Technical Debt - Limited Test Coverage).
    **Priority:** High
    **Estimated Effort:** High

3.  **Requirement ID:** `CORE-003`
    **Title:** Enhance Error Handling Granularity and Reporting
    **Description:** Refine error handling across the application, particularly within the `runtime` module and agent execution logic. Implement more specific exception catching and ensure all errors are logged with sufficient context. Improve the reporting of errors to the user, potentially including more detailed diagnostic information.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.5 (Architecture Analysis - Error Handling), T-00.6 (Technical Debt - Inconsistent Error Handling).
    **Priority:** Medium
    **Estimated Effort:** Medium

4.  **Requirement ID:** `CORE-004`
    **Title:** Refactor `MainWindow` UI Management
    **Description:** Decompose the monolithic `MainWindow` class into smaller, more manageable components or presenter classes. Separate concerns related to plan view management, log display, artifact browsing, and agent configuration into distinct modules.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.6 (Technical Debt - UI State Management Complexity).
    **Priority:** Medium
    **Estimated Effort:** High

5.  **Requirement ID:** `CORE-005`
    **Title:** Improve Documentation Coverage
    **Description:** Add comprehensive docstrings to all public classes and methods, especially within the `runtime` module. Create an architectural overview document and ensure agent configuration documentation is clear and accessible.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.5 (Architecture Analysis - Documentation Gaps), T-00.6 (Technical Debt - Documentation Gaps).
    **Priority:** Medium
    **Estimated Effort:** Medium

## II. Scalability Improvements

6.  **Requirement ID:** `SCALE-001`
    **Title:** Parallelize LLM Provider Interactions
    **Description:** Implement asynchronous operations for LLM API calls within the `runtime` module. Introduce configurable concurrency limits, batching capabilities, and robust retry mechanisms for rate-limited requests.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.7 (Scalability Analysis - LLM Provider Performance).
    **Priority:** High
    **Estimated Effort:** High

7.  **Requirement ID:** `SCALE-002`
    **Title:** Enable Parallel Task Execution
    **Description:** Modify the `runtime.System.run()` method to support parallel execution of independent tasks using a thread or process pool. This requires improved analysis of task dependencies.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.7 (Scalability Analysis - Sequential Task Execution).
    **Priority:** High
    **Estimated Effort:** High

8.  **Requirement ID:** `SCALE-003`
    **Title:** Optimize Plan Generation Performance
    **Description:** Profile and optimize the `runtime.System.start()` method to reduce the time taken for plan generation, especially for complex goals and large contexts.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.7 (Scalability Analysis - Inefficient Plan Generation).
    **Priority:** Medium
    **Estimated Effort:** Medium

9.  **Requirement ID:** `SCALE-004`
    **Title:** Enhance Handling of Large Context Files
    **Description:** Implement strategies for efficient handling of large context files, such as lazy loading, chunking, or memory-efficient processing, to reduce memory footprint and startup times.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.7 (Scalability Analysis - Large Number of Context Files).
    **Priority:** Medium
    **Estimated Effort:** Medium

## III. Feature Enhancements

10. **Requirement ID:** `FEAT-001`
    **Title:** Develop Advanced Agent Management UI
    **Description:** Enhance the `AgentConfigDialog` or create a new dedicated UI component for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on agent configurations, including inline editing, validation, and potentially agent testing.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.8 (Feature Opportunities - Enhanced Agent Configuration).
    **Priority:** High
    **Estimated Effort:** High

11. **Requirement ID:** `FEAT-002`
    **Title:** Implement Visual Workflow Designer
    **Description:** Develop a graphical interface for visualizing, designing, and potentially editing agent workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This should integrate with the `Plan` object generated by the system.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.8 (Feature Opportunities - Visual Workflow Designer).
    **Priority:** Medium
    **Estimated Effort:** Very High

12. **Requirement ID:** `FEAT-003`
    **Title:** Enhance Context File Management
    **Description:** Introduce features for tagging/categorizing context files, improving file previews within the UI, managing historical context sets, and potentially incorporating directory watchers for automatic updates.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.8 (Feature Opportunities - Advanced File Context Management).
    **Priority:** Medium
    **Estimated Effort:** Medium

13. **Requirement ID:** `FEAT-004`
    **Title:** Improve LLM Provider and Model Selection UI
    **Description:** Enhance the UI for selecting LLM providers and models, including better filtering, display of model capabilities, and secure management of API keys. Consider adding LLM performance metrics tracking.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.8 (Feature Opportunities - Enhanced LLM Management).
    **Priority:** Medium
    **Estimated Effort:** Medium

## IV. Future Considerations (Lower Priority / Long-Term)

14. **Requirement ID:** `FUT-001`
    **Title:** Explore Real-time Collaboration Features
    **Description:** Investigate and prototype features for multi-user collaboration, such as shared workflows, real-time chat, and version control integration.
    **Source Tasks:** T-00.8 (Feature Opportunities - Real-time Collaboration).
    **Priority:** Low
    **Estimated Effort:** Very High
