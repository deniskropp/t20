      "component": "Overall UI/UX Flow",
      "finding": "The user flow from input to processing to output is clear and intuitive. The low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity mockups are consistent, providing a solid foundation. The visual hierarchy is well-maintained across all states.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "Continue with development as planned. Monitor user feedback post-launch for any emergent usability issues.",
      "status": "Addressed"
    },
    {
      "id": "ui_ux_review_002",
      "component": "Input Screen",
      "finding": "The 'Your Prompt' textarea is appropriately sized and styled. The 'Generate' button is prominent and uses the primary brand color, ensuring discoverability. Placeholder text is clear.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "Ensure the textarea allows for sufficient text input and scrolling if content exceeds its initial height.",
      "status": "Addressed"
    },
    {
      "id": "ui_ux_review_003",
      "component": "Processing State Visualization",
      "finding": "The 'AI is thinking...' animated dots and status message provide good feedback during processing. The disabled state of the input textarea correctly indicates that user input is not possible during this phase.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "Confirm that the animation is subtle and not distracting, and that the status message updates if processing takes longer than expected.",
      "status": "Addressed"
    },
    {
      "id": "ui_ux_review_004",
      "component": "Output Display",
      "finding": "The AI response is clearly delineated from the input prompt. The 'Refine Prompt' and 'New Request' buttons offer clear next steps for the user.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "Ensure that any Markdown formatting within the AI's `final_output` is rendered correctly and legibly.",

    {
      "id": "ui_ux_review_005",
      "component": "Error Handling",
      "finding": "The error alert message is visually distinct (using `Alarm Red` and `FEF2F2` background) and provides actionable buttons ('Try Again', 'Refine Prompt'). The inclusion of `role='alert'` and `aria-live='assertive'` is crucial for accessibility.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "Verify that the `error_details.message` from the API is informative and guides the user effectively.",
      "status": "Addressed"

    {
      "id": "accessibility_review_001",
      "component": "Color Contrast",
      "finding": "The color palette defined in the UI kit appears to meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements for text and interactive elements. For example, `Charcoal` text on `Cloud White` background has excellent contrast.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "Perform automated and manual contrast checks during development to confirm compliance, especially for any newly introduced elements or dynamic states.",

      "id": "accessibility_review_002",
      "component": "Keyboard Navigation",
      "finding": "All interactive elements (buttons, textarea) have been designed with keyboard operability in mind, including focus states. The `aria-label` attributes specified in the technical specifications are essential for screen reader users.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "Thoroughly test keyboard navigation on the implemented application. Ensure focus order is logical and visible focus indicators are present and clear.",

    {
      "id": "accessibility_review_003",
      "component": "Screen Reader Support",
      "finding": "The use of semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<button>`, `<textarea>`) and specific ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `role='alert'`, `aria-live`) is appropriate for screen reader support. The `thinking_process` steps and the `final_output` should be announced correctly.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "Conduct actual screen reader testing (e.g., using NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) to confirm that all content and interactive elements are announced understandably and in the correct order.",
      "status": "Addressed"
    },
    {
      "id": "accessibility_review_004",
      "component": "Responsiveness",
      "finding": "The design specifications and mockups imply a responsive layout that should adapt well across different screen sizes. The use of consistent padding and font sizes across states aids in a predictable experience.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "Verify responsiveness across a range of devices and viewport sizes during development and final testing. Ensure no content is cut off or becomes unusable on smaller screens.",

      "id": "discrepancy_001",
      "component": "Placeholder Text in Textareas",
      "finding": "The `hf_input_001` mockup uses 'Ask me anything...' as placeholder text for the user input textarea, while the `technical_specifications` for the `Textarea` component mention `placeholderColor: var(--color-muted-gray)`. The `hf_input_001` also specifies a `height` of '150px'. These are consistent with the low-fidelity version.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "No action needed, the design appears consistent.",
      "status": "Addressed"
    },
    {
      "id": "discrepancy_002",
      "component": "Button Styling Consistency",
      "finding": "The `hf_output_001` mockup shows a 'Refine Prompt' button with success green styling, and a 'New Request' button with secondary styling. The `technical_specifications.components.button` correctly defines these variants. The `hf_error_001` mockup also shows a 'Try Again' button (default blue) and 'Refine Prompt' (secondary gray), which align with the defined variants.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "No action needed, button variants are consistently defined.",
      "status": "Addressed"

      "component": "Visual Indicator Animation",
      "finding": "The `hf_processing_001` mockup specifies an 'animated_dots' indicator with `color: #3B82F6`. The `technical_specifications.components.visual_indicator.animated_dots` details `animation: 'blink 1.4s infinite both'`. The implementation should ensure this animation is present and functions as described.",
      "severity": "None",
      "recommendation": "Ensure the animation is implemented accurately and efficiently during development.",
      "status": "Addressed"
    }

  "overall_assessment": "The design and specifications provided are comprehensive and well-aligned. The UI/UX is user-centered, and accessibility has been a strong consideration throughout the design process. No significant discrepancies were found between the high-fidelity mockups, UI kit, and technical specifications. The planned implementation details by Kodax appear to cover all necessary aspects for a successful build.",
  "next_steps_recommendation": "Proceed with the implementation of the frontend components and integration with the AI API as per the established plans. Conduct thorough testing, including accessibility audits and user acceptance testing, before final deployment."
