Each neuron in these layers takes inputs from the previous layer, does a calculation, and passes its output to the next layer. They learn to identify features.\n3.  **Output Layer:** This layer gives you the final result (e.g., 'This is a cat', 'The sentiment is positive').\n\n**How it learns:** It's trained by being shown many examples (e.g., thousands of cat pictures labeled 'cat'). If it makes a mistake, the connections (weights) between neurons are adjusted slightly to reduce the error. Over time, through many adjustments, it gets really good at recognizing patterns without being explicitly programmed for each one. It's how AI can do things like facial recognition or understand speech!"

Early pioneers like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Herbert A. Simon began exploring problem-solving and symbolic AI.\n*   **First AI Spring (1950s-1970s):** Development of programs like ELIZA and SHRDLU showed early promise in natural language processing and robotics. However, limitations soon became apparent.\n*   **First AI Winter (1970s-1980s):** Funding cuts and a realization of the immense difficulty of common-sense reasoning led to a slowdown.\n*   **Expert Systems Boom (1980s):** Rule-based expert systems saw commercial success, leading to a resurgence of interest and a second AI spring.\n*   **Second AI Winter (1980s-1990s):** The limitations of expert systems and the rise of personal computing again led to reduced investment.\n*   **Statistical AI & Machine Learning (1990s-2000s):** Focus shifted from symbolic AI to statistical methods, with breakthroughs in machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines and boosting. IBM's Deep Blue beating Garry Kasparov (1997) was a landmark.\n*   **Deep Learning Revolution (2010s-Present):** Fueled by vast datasets, powerful GPUs, and new algorithms, deep neural networks achieved remarkable success in image recognition, natural language processing (e.g., Transformers), and game playing (e.g., AlphaGo). This period marks the current AI 'spring' with widespread adoption and rapid advancements."
