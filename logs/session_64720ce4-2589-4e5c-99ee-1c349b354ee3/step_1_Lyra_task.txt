The overall goal is: 'Create a website that is a frontend to an AI system like this.'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Create a detailed workflow for the 'Project Scoping and Foundational Design' phase. Draft an initial system prompt for Aurora to begin the design process, focusing on user flows for an AI interaction interface.'

The team's roles are:
