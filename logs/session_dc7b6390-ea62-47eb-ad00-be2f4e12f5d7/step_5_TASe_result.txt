    "description": "Assess the effectiveness of the refactoring changes by comparing the system's state against predefined success metrics. This involves measuring improvements in areas such as performance, maintainability, and code quality. The evaluation should identify whether the refactoring objectives have been met and whether any unintended side effects have been introduced. This includes gathering quantitative data (e.g., performance benchmarks, code complexity metrics) and qualitative feedback (e.g., developer satisfaction, user experience reports).",
