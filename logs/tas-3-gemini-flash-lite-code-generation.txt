**High-Level Goal:** code generation

**Phase 1: Preparation and Contextualization**
1.  **Define the Specific High-Level Goal:** The goal is "code generation".
2.  **Internalize Task Agnostic Step (TAS) Principles:** Understood the definition, characteristics (Generality, Reusability, Abstraction, Action-Oriented, Independence, Sequential Potential), and purpose of TAS.
3.  **Review TAS Identification Criteria:** Familiarized with the criteria: generality, domain-agnosticism, focus on method, verb-noun phrase, self-contained, general methodology applicability.
4.  **Understand the Target Data Structure:** Reviewed the JSON schema for `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, `purpose`, and optional fields.
5.  **Grasp Presentation Guidelines for Content Quality:** Noted guidelines for clarity, conciseness, and the specific presentation of each field.

**Phase 2: Decomposition and Candidate Identification**

6.  **Initial Goal Decomposition (Brainstorming):**
    *   Understand requirements for the code.
    *   Design the code structure.
    *   Write the code.
    *   Test the code.
    *   Refactor the code.
    *   Document the code.
    *   Generate code based on specifications.
    *   Choose a programming language/framework.
    *   Configure the generation environment.
    *   Validate generated code.
    *   Optimize generated code.

7.  **Identify Potential Task Agnostic Step Candidates:**
    *   Understand requirements -> **Gather Requirements**
    *   Design the code structure -> **Design Solution Structure**
    *   Write the code -> **Develop Solution**
    *   Test the code -> **Test Solution**
    *   Refactor the code -> **Refine Solution**
    *   Document the code -> **Document Solution**
    *   Generate code based on specifications -> **Generate Artifact** (more general than code)
    *   Choose a programming language/framework -> **Select Tools/Technologies**
    *   Configure the generation environment -> **Configure Environment**
    *   Validate generated code -> **Validate Artifact**
    *   Optimize generated code -> **Optimize Solution**

8.  **Refine and Abstract Candidate Steps:**
    *   **Gather Requirements:** General enough.
    *   **Design Solution Structure:** General enough.
    *   **Develop Solution:** General enough.
    *   **Test Solution:** General enough.
    *   **Refine Solution:** General enough.
    *   **Document Solution:** General enough.
    *   **Generate Artifact:** This is a core step for code generation.
    *   **Select Tools/Technologies:** General enough.
    *   **Configure Environment:** General enough.
    *   **Validate Artifact:** General enough.
    *   **Optimize Solution:** General enough.

**Phase 3: Structuring and Detailing Each Task Agnostic Step**

*(Generating TAS based on refined candidates and detailed content)*

**Phase 4: Review and Validation**
*(Self-review against criteria and schema)*
