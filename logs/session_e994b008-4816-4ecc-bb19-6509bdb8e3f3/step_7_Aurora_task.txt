Your current task is to refine the prompt for the Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) Extractor. The goal is to ensure the TAS Extractor accurately identifies and extracts relevant TAS, avoiding ambiguity and irrelevance. Consider the following when refining the prompt:\n\n1.  **Specificity:** Ensure the prompt clearly defines what constitutes a Task-Agnostic Step (TAS). Provide examples of what is and is not a TAS.\n2.  **Context:** The TAS Extractor will be processing text descriptions of tasks. The prompt should instruct the extractor to consider the context of each task when identifying TAS.\n3.  **Relevance:** The prompt should emphasize the importance of extracting only TAS that are genuinely relevant to creating a task-agnostic plan. Avoid extracting steps that are too specific or trivial.\n4.  **Format:** The prompt should specify the desired output format for the extracted TAS (e.g., a list of concise descriptions).\n5.  **Error Handling:** The prompt should instruct the extractor on how to handle cases where no TAS are found or where the task description is unclear.\n\nYour refined prompt should minimize ambiguity and maximize the accuracy of TAS extraction.

Provide examples of TAS (e.g., 'Gather Information,' 'Analyze Data,' 'Develop Solutions') and non-TAS (e.g., 'Write a Python script,' 'Conduct a customer survey').\n\n2. **Contextual Awareness:** The TAS Extractor will be processing text descriptions of tasks. The prompt should instruct the extractor to consider the *intent* and *purpose* behind each step in the task description to identify the underlying TAS. Emphasize identifying the *generalizable action* rather than specific implementations.\n\n3. **Relevance & Abstraction:** The prompt should emphasize extracting TAS that are broadly relevant to creating a task-agnostic plan. Avoid extracting steps that are overly specific to a single task or are trivial details. Focus on actions that represent key stages in a problem-solving or planning process.\n\n4. **Output Format:** The prompt should specify a structured output format for the extracted TAS.

In such cases, the extractor should prioritize the most generalizable interpretation.\n\nYour refined prompt should minimize ambiguity and maximize the accuracy of TAS extraction.

You should focus on clarity, conciseness, and ensuring the prompts align with the overall goal of generating a robust task-agnostic plan. Your current task is to create example prompts that demonstrate how to use the task-agnostic plan to guide the execution of specific tasks and provide clear instructions on how to adapt the plan to different scenarios.\n\nConsider the existing Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) provided in the previous steps, which include 'Define Objectives', 'Gather Information', 'Analyze Data', 'Develop Solutions', 'Evaluate Options', 'Select Solution', 'Develop Implementation Plan', 'Execute Plan', 'Monitor Progress', and 'Adjust Plan'. Use these TAS to construct prompts for the Engineer (Kodax) to execute specific tasks. The prompts should clearly articulate how to leverage the TAS in different scenarios.\n\nHere are some example scenarios and corresponding prompts:\n\n**Scenario 1: Developing a Marketing Campaign**\n\nPrompt:\n'Using the provided Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS), develop a detailed plan for creating and executing a new marketing campaign. Focus on the following:\n1.  **Define Objectives:** Clearly define the goals of the campaign (e.g., increase brand awareness, generate leads, drive sales). Be specific and measurable.\n2.  **Gather Information:** Research the target audience, market trends, and competitor activities. Identify key insights to inform the campaign strategy.\n3.  **Analyze Data:** Analyze the gathered information to identify opportunities and challenges. Determine the most effective channels and messaging for reaching the target audience.\n4.  **Develop Solutions:** Brainstorm different campaign ideas and approaches. Consider various marketing channels (e.g., social media, email, paid advertising).\n5.  **Evaluate Options:** Assess the feasibility, cost, and potential impact of each campaign idea. Select the most promising options.\n6.  **Select Solution:** Choose the final campaign strategy and approach. Justify your decision based on the evaluation results.\n7.  **Develop Implementation Plan:** Create a detailed plan for executing the campaign, including timelines, budgets, and resource allocation.\n8.  **Execute Plan:** Implement the campaign according to the plan. Monitor progress and make adjustments as needed.\n9.  **Monitor Progress:** Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as website traffic, lead generation, and sales conversions.\n10. **Adjust Plan:** Make necessary adjustments to the campaign based on the monitoring results. Optimize the campaign for maximum impact.\n\nProvide a detailed breakdown of each TAS, including specific actions, timelines, and responsible parties. The final output should be a comprehensive marketing campaign plan.'\n\n**Scenario 2: Improving Customer Service**\n\nPrompt:\n'Using the provided Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS), develop a plan for improving customer service within a company. Focus on the following:\n1.  **Define Objectives:** Clearly define the goals of the customer service improvement initiative (e.g., reduce customer churn, increase customer satisfaction, improve response times).\n2.  **Gather Information:** Collect data on current customer service performance, including customer feedback, support tickets, and survey results.\n3.  **Analyze Data:** Analyze the collected data to identify pain points and areas for improvement.\n4.  **Develop Solutions:** Brainstorm different solutions for addressing the identified pain points. Consider various options such as improving training, implementing new technologies, or streamlining processes.\n5.  **Evaluate Options:** Assess the feasibility, cost, and potential impact of each solution. Select the most promising options.\n6.  **Select Solution:** Choose the final set of solutions to implement. Justify your decision based on the evaluation results.\n7.  **Develop Implementation Plan:** Create a detailed plan for implementing the chosen solutions, including timelines, budgets, and resource allocation.\n8.  **Execute Plan:** Implement the solutions according to the plan. Monitor progress and make adjustments as needed.\n9.  **Monitor Progress:** Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer satisfaction scores, response times, and resolution rates.\n10. **Adjust Plan:** Make necessary adjustments to the implementation plan based on the monitoring results. Optimize the customer service improvement initiative for maximum impact.\n\nProvide a detailed breakdown of each TAS, including specific actions, timelines, and responsible parties. The final output should be a comprehensive customer service improvement plan.'\n\n**Instructions on Adapting the Plan to Different Scenarios:**\n\n*   **Define Objectives:** Always start by clearly defining the goals of the task or project. This will provide a clear direction for the entire plan.\n*   **Gather Information:** Tailor the information gathering process to the specific context of the task. Identify the relevant data sources and collection methods.\n*   **Analyze Data:** Use appropriate analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights from the gathered data.\n*   **Develop Solutions:** Brainstorm a wide range of potential solutions, considering different approaches and perspectives.\n*   **Evaluate Options:** Use a consistent set of criteria to evaluate each option, such as feasibility, cost, and potential impact.\n*   **Select Solution:** Choose the option that best meets the defined objectives and constraints.\n*   **Develop Implementation Plan:** Create a detailed plan for putting the chosen solution into action, including specific tasks, timelines, and resource allocation.\n*   **Execute Plan:** Implement the plan according to the defined steps and timelines.\n*   **Monitor Progress:** Track key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the effectiveness of the plan.\n*   **Adjust Plan:** Make necessary adjustments to the plan based on the monitoring results, ensuring that the desired outcomes are achieved.\n\nBy following these instructions and adapting the TAS to the specific context of each task, you can create effective plans for a wide range of scenarios."

  "overall_architecture": "The system will be a modular application consisting of four main modules: plan_generator, input_validator, data_access, and ui.  The ui module will handle user interaction, taking a goal as input. The input_validator module will validate the input goal. The data_access module will retrieve the TAS data. The plan_generator module will then use the valid goal and TAS data to generate a task-specific plan. The UI will then display the generated plan to the user in a user-friendly manner.  Error handling will be implemented in each module to ensure the system is robust. Logging will be used to track the execution of the system and identify potential issues.",
  "accessibility_considerations": "The UI will be designed with accessibility in mind, adhering to WCAG guidelines. This includes providing appropriate color contrast, using semantic HTML, providing alt text for images, and ensuring keyboard navigation is fully supported. Font sizes will be adjustable, and the layout will be responsive to accommodate different screen sizes and devices.",
  "responsive_design_considerations": "The UI will be built using a responsive design framework to ensure it adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This includes using flexible layouts, responsive images, and media queries to adjust the presentation of the content based on the screen size. The design will be tested on a variety of devices to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience.",
  "testing_strategy": "A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented to ensure the system meets the specified requirements. This includes unit tests to verify the correctness of individual functions and modules, integration tests to verify the interaction between different modules, and end-to-end tests to verify the overall functionality of the system.  Test cases will be developed to cover a variety of scenarios, including valid and invalid input, edge cases, and error conditions.  Automated testing will be used to ensure that the system remains robust and reliable as it evolves."
