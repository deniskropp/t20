The overall goal is: 'create a task agnostic plan'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Implement designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Translate the task-agnostic plan into a structured format (e.g., JSON schema, YAML) that can be easily parsed and utilized by other systems or agents. Ensure the format is well-documented and extensible.'

Please use the following outputs from the other agents as your input:

You should focus on clarity, conciseness, and ensuring the prompts align with the overall goal of generating a robust task-agnostic plan. Your current task is to refine the prompt for the Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) Extractor. The goal is to ensure the TAS Extractor accurately identifies and extracts relevant TAS, avoiding ambiguity and irrelevance. Consider the following when refining the prompt:\n\n1.  **Specificity:** Ensure the prompt clearly defines what constitutes a Task-Agnostic Step (TAS). Provide examples of what is and is not a TAS.\n2.  **Context:** The TAS Extractor will be processing text descriptions of tasks. The prompt should instruct the extractor to consider the context of each task when identifying TAS.\n3.  **Relevance:** The prompt should emphasize the importance of extracting only TAS that are genuinely relevant to creating a task-agnostic plan. Avoid extracting steps that are too specific or trivial.\n4.  **Format:** The prompt should specify the desired output format for the extracted TAS (e.g., a list of concise descriptions).\n5.  **Error Handling:** The prompt should instruct the extractor on how to handle cases where no TAS are found or where the task description is unclear.\n\nYour refined prompt should minimize ambiguity and maximize the accuracy of TAS extraction.

Consider the following when refining the prompt:\n\n1. **Specificity:** Ensure the prompt clearly defines what constitutes a Task-Agnostic Step (TAS).

Provide examples of TAS (e.g., 'Gather Information,' 'Analyze Data,' 'Develop Solutions') and non-TAS (e.g., 'Write a Python script,' 'Conduct a customer survey').\n\n2. **Contextual Awareness:** The TAS Extractor will be processing text descriptions of tasks. The prompt should instruct the extractor to consider the *intent* and *purpose* behind each step in the task description to identify the underlying TAS. Emphasize identifying the *generalizable action* rather than specific implementations.\n\n3. **Relevance & Abstraction:** The prompt should emphasize extracting TAS that are broadly relevant to creating a task-agnostic plan. Avoid extracting steps that are overly specific to a single task or are trivial details. Focus on actions that represent key stages in a problem-solving or planning process.\n\n4. **Output Format:** The prompt should specify a structured output format for the extracted TAS.

In such cases, the extractor should prioritize the most generalizable interpretation.\n\nYour refined prompt should minimize ambiguity and maximize the accuracy of TAS extraction.
