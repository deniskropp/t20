**Explanation:**

1.  **HTML Structure:**
    *   Sets up a basic HTML5 document with a title and some basic styling.
    *   A `div` with the class `container` holds all the content.
    *   `h1` for the main title.
    *   `h2` for section titles.
    *   `div id="stepsContainer"`: This is where the individual development steps will be dynamically inserted by JavaScript.
    *   `div id="kodaxResult"` and `div id="auroraResult"`: These divs are placeholders for the content fetched from `step_6_Kodax_result.txt` and `step_7_Aurora_result.txt` respectively. They contain `pre` tags to display the text content with preserved formatting.

2.  **CSS Styling:**
    *   Provides a clean and modern look with a sans-serif font, a light background, and distinct styling for steps and result sections.
    *   Each `.step` has a left border, padding, and a subtle hover effect for interactivity.
    *   The `.role` and `.task` within a step are styled for better readability.
    *   The `pre` tags are styled to ensure code or text content is displayed clearly.

3.  **JavaScript Logic:**
    *   **`stepsData` Array:** This array holds the JSON data provided in your prompt, representing the different roles and tasks in the development process.
    *   **`displaySteps(steps)` function:**
        *   Takes the `stepsData` array as input.
        *   Clears any existing content in the `stepsContainer`.
        *   Iterates through each `step` object in the array.
        *   For each step, it creates a `div` element with the class `step`.
        *   It populates the `div` with the role and task, formatted with spans for styling.
        *   Appends the created `stepElement` to the `stepsContainer`.
    *   **`fetchAndDisplayFileContent(filename, elementId)` function:**
        *   This is the core function for fetching external file content using Axios.
        *   It takes the `filename` (e.g., 'step_6_Kodax_result.txt') and the `elementId` where the content should be displayed.
        *   It uses `axios.get(filename)` to make an HTTP GET request to fetch the content of the specified file.
        *   If the request is successful (`await axios.get(...)`), it takes the `response.data` (the file content) and sets it as the `textContent` of the element identified by `elementId`.
        *   If there's an error (e.g., file not found, network issue), it logs the error to the console and displays an informative message in the target element.
    *   **`DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener:**
        *   This ensures that the JavaScript code runs only after the entire HTML document has been fully loaded and parsed.
        *   It first calls `displaySteps(stepsData)` to render the development steps.
        *   Then, it calls `fetchAndDisplayFileContent` twice:
            *   Once for `step_6_Kodax_result.txt` to update the `kodaxContent` element.
            *   Once for `step_7_Aurora_result.txt` to update the `auroraContent` element.

**To Use This Code:**

1.  **Save the HTML:** Save the code above as an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).
2.  **Create Text Files:** Create two text files in the **same directory** as your `index.html` file:
    *   `step_6_Kodax_result.txt`
    *   `step_7_Aurora_result.txt`
    *   **Populate these files with the actual content you want to display.**
3.  **Serve the Files:** You need a web server to serve these files because `axios.get` makes HTTP requests.
    *   **Simple Python Server:** If you have Python installed, open your terminal in the directory where you saved the files and run:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
        Then, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
    *   **Node.js Server (using `http-server`):** If you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install `http-server` globally (`npm install -g http-server`) and then run `http-server` in your directory.
4.  **Open in Browser:** Navigate to the address provided by your web server (usually `http://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost:8080`).

The page will load, display the development steps, and then fetch and display the content from your `.txt` files using Axios.
