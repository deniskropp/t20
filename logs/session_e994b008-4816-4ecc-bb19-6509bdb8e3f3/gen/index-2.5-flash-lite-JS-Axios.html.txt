**Explanation:**

1.  **HTML Structure:**
    *   Sets up a basic HTML5 document with a title and some inline CSS for styling.
    *   A `div` with class `container` holds all the content.
    *   `h1` for the main title.
    *   A `div` with class `section-title` and `id="coreSteps"` displays the initial list of roles and tasks provided in your input. Each step is wrapped in a `div` with class `step`.
    *   `div id="goalInputSection"`: Contains a label, an input field (`<input type="text" id="goalInput">`) for the user to enter their goal, and a button (`<button id="generatePlanBtn">`) to trigger the plan generation.
    *   `div id="generatedPlanSection"`: This section is initially hidden (`class="hidden"`) and will be shown once a plan is generated. It contains a heading and a `div` (`id="generatedPlanContent"`) where the dynamically generated plan will be displayed.

2.  **CSS Styling:**
    *   Provides a clean, modern look with a light background, distinct sections, and styled steps.
    *   Uses `border-left` on the `.step` elements to visually represent the progression.
    *   Includes a simple `:hover` effect for the steps.
    *   Styles the input section and the generated plan section with different background colors to differentiate them.
    *   The `.hidden` class simply sets `display: none;`.

3.  **JavaScript Logic:**
    *   **Axios Inclusion:** The line `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>` includes the Axios library from a CDN, making it available for making HTTP requests.
    *   **Element References:** Gets references to the input field, button, and the sections for displaying the generated plan.
    *   **`taskAgnosticSteps` Array:** This array holds the initial list of steps provided in your JSON. In a real application, this data might be fetched from a backend.
    *   **`generateTaskSpecificPlan(goal)` Function:**
        *   This `async` function simulates the process of generating a task-specific plan.
        *   **Mocking:** It currently takes the `taskAgnosticSteps` and slightly modifies them based on the input `goal` to create a "task-specific" feel.
        *   **Axios Simulation:** The `try...catch` block demonstrates how you *would* use Axios to send the `goal` and `taskAgnosticSteps` to a backend API (`/api/generate-plan`). It then simulates a network delay (`setTimeout`) and returns the mocked plan.
        *   **Error Handling:** Includes basic error logging and returns an error message if the simulated API call fails.
    *   **Event Listener for Button:**
        *   When the "Generate Plan" button is clicked:
            *   It retrieves the `goal` from the input field.
            *   It performs basic validation (checks if the goal is empty).
            *   It disables the button and changes its text to "Generating..." to provide user feedback.
            *   It hides the `generatedPlanSection` while processing.
            *   It calls `generateTaskSpecificPlan()` to get the plan.
            *   It constructs HTML for the generated plan, iterating through the `plan` array.
            *   It injects the generated HTML into `generatedPlanContent`.
            *   It makes the `generatedPlanSection` visible.
            *   It re-enables the button and resets its text.

**To Run This:**

1.  Save the code as an HTML file (e.g., `task_planner.html`).
2.  Open the file in your web browser.

You will see the initial list of steps. You can then enter a goal (like "Learn to play the guitar") and click "Generate Plan". The system will simulate generating a plan based on that goal and display it below.
