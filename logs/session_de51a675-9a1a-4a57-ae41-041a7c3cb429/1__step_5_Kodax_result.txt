  "output": "I have developed a basic, adaptable structure for the YouTube short script on co-evolutionary greetings. This template includes placeholders for key script elements like visual cues, dialogue, and timing, making it easy to populate with specific examples and adapt for different co-evolutionary scenarios. It adheres to the outlined narrative arc and incorporates suggestions for visual elements.",
