  "review_status": "complete",
  "feedback": {
    "overall_assessment": "Both Aurora's design specifications and Kodax's implementation plan demonstrate exceptional clarity, detail, and cohesion. They are perfectly aligned with the 'System Overview' goal and the refined requirements provided.",
    "alignment_with_goal": "Both agents consistently adhere to the 'personalized, glanceable dashboard' concept. Aurora's design vision and UI layouts directly support immediate insight and reduced cognitive load, while Kodax's technical plan ensures efficient data delivery and a scalable foundation for this experience. All aspects contribute cohesively to the 'System Overview' goal.",
    "cohesion_between_agents": "There is a strong, direct mapping and synergy between Aurora's detailed UI elements, user interaction flows, and accessibility guidelines, and Kodax's corresponding technical components, data structures, API integrations, and accessibility implementation strategies. For instance, Aurora's specified interactive elements and system responses are directly supported by Kodax's API endpoints and component responsibilities. The handling of loading and error states is also consistently defined across both outputs.",
    "actionability": "The artifacts are highly actionable, providing sufficient detail for a development team to proceed with implementation without ambiguity. The granular breakdown of UI elements, user flows, data structures, API contracts, and architectural components ensures a clear path forward.",
    "impact_of_previous_refinements": "The refinements applied to Aurora's and Kodax's system prompts in the previous step (step 3) have clearly led to optimized and highly synergistic outputs from both agents, fulfilling the objective of improved specificity and coherence.",
    "recommendations_for_next_steps": "No immediate prompt refinements are required based on this review, as the current outputs are excellent and meet the initial refined goals. For future iterations or expansion of the project scope, it might be beneficial to explore more granular details on specific API error handling responses (e.g., mapping error codes to user-facing messages), quantifiable performance targets, or deeper security considerations beyond authentication."
