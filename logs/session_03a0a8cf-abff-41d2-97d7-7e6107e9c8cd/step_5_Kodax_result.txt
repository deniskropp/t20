        "component_based_design": "The UI will be broken down into small, reusable, and self-contained components (e.g., `SummaryCard`, `ProductivityChart`, `TopNavBar`). This promotes maintainability, reusability, and easier testing.",
        "container_presenter_pattern": "Logic-heavy components (Containers like `DashboardScreen`) will be separated from purely presentational components (Presenters like `SummaryCard`). Containers will handle data fetching, state management, and business logic, while presenters will focus solely on rendering UI based on props.",
        "feature_sliced_design": "Codebase will be organized by feature (e.g., `features/dashboard`, `features/tasks`, `features/profile`) rather than by type (e.g., `components`, `services`). This improves scalability and makes it easier to understand and work on specific parts of the application.",

        "error_handling_middleware": "Global Axios/fetch interceptors will be configured to handle common HTTP error codes (e.g., 401 for unauthorized, 500 for server errors), potentially redirecting to login or displaying generic error messages.",
        "authentication_flow": "JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) obtained during login will be securely stored (e.g., `AsyncStorage` on mobile, `localStorage` on web) and automatically attached as Bearer tokens to all authenticated API requests via Axios interceptors.",

        "aria_attributes": "ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-current='page'`, `role='button'`, `aria-live='polite'`) will be applied to enhance screen reader interpretation, especially for dynamic content updates (e.g., notification badge) and interactive elements (summary cards, navigation items).",
        "keyboard_navigation": "All interactive elements will be keyboard navigable (`tabindex` for web, default focusable for native components). Proper focus management will be implemented for modal dialogs (e.g., `Task Creation` modal) ensuring focus is trapped within and returned to the trigger element upon close.",
        "color_contrast_validation": "Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text/UI components) will be enforced using design tokens and automated testing tools. Semantic colors (e.g., red for overdue) will always be accompanied by non-color cues (icons, text labels).",
        "scalable_text_support": "Font sizes will be defined using relative units (`rem` for web, `sp` for React Native) to ensure text scales gracefully when system font sizes are increased by the user. Layouts will be tested to prevent text truncation or overlap.",

        "testing_and_auditing": "Automated accessibility tests (e.g., Jest-axe, Cypress-axe) will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Regular manual accessibility audits using screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack, NVDA/JAWS) will be conducted."
