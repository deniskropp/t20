The review of Aurora's design specifications and Kodax's implementation plan confirms <<EXCEPTIONAL ALIGNMENT>> with the 'System Overview' goal. Both agents' outputs are detailed, cohesive, and actionable.

<<AURORA'S DESIGN>> clearly defines a personalized, glanceable dashboard, emphasizing reduced cognitive load and a clear path forward. The UI layouts for mobile and web are comprehensive, detailing elements, interactions, and accessibility considerations. The UI flow logically maps user actions to system responses, and the color palette and typography adhere to accessibility standards.

<<KODAX'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN>> directly supports Aurora's design. The data structures and API endpoints are well-defined, enabling the retrieval and manipulation of data needed for the dashboard. The architectural components and recommended tech stack provide a solid foundation for building a scalable and performant application. The plan also explicitly addresses responsive design and accessibility, ensuring these critical aspects are integrated from the start.

<<COHESION BETWEEN AGENTS>> is strong. Aurora's UI elements and flows are directly mapped to Kodax's API endpoints and data structures. For example, the `TaskSummary` data structure directly informs the metrics displayed on Aurora's summary cards, and the `GET /api/v1/dashboard` endpoint is specified by Kodax to fulfill the data needs of Aurora's main dashboard screen.

<<IMPACT OF PREVIOUS REFINEMENTS>> is evident. The system prompts refined in step 3 have clearly guided both agents to produce highly specific and synergistic outputs, fulfilling the objective of improved specificity and coherence.

<<RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS>>: No immediate prompt refinements are required. The current outputs are excellent and meet the initial refined goals. For future iterations, consider exploring:
*   More granular API error handling details (e.g., specific error codes and user-facing messages).
*   Quantifiable performance targets for key metrics (e.g., dashboard load time).
*   Deeper security considerations beyond authentication (e.g., data encryption at rest).
