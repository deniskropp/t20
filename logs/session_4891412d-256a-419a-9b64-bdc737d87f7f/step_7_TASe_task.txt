The overall goal is: 'Create a single HTML page with your Teams mission statement and vision'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and extract 'Task Agnostic Steps' (TAS) for achieving high-level goals.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Perform a final review of the HTML page to ensure it meets all requirements and is ready for deployment. This includes checking for errors, validating accessibility, and optimizing performance.'

Please use the following outputs from the other agents as your input:
