The overall goal is: 'Create a dataset for LLM fine-tuning towards internalized TAS expertise'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Generate 10 diverse, high-quality seed examples of TAS plans based on the schema defined by Lyra. These examples will serve as the foundation for the dataset.'

The team's roles are:
    {'roles': [{'title': 'Designer', 'description': 'Generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.'}, {'title': 'Engineer', 'description': 'Implement designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.'}, {'title': 'Prompt Engineer', 'description': 'Structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering'}, {'title': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'description': "Identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal."}], 'steps': [{'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': "Define the JSON schema for the fine-tuning dataset. The schema must structure entries as pairs of 'high-level goal' and its corresponding 'TAS plan'."}, {'name': 'TASe', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'task': 'Generate 10 diverse, high-quality seed examples of TAS plans based on the schema defined by Lyra. These examples will serve as the foundation for the dataset.'}, {'name': 'Aurora', 'role': 'Designer', 'task': 'Design a minimalist and intuitive user interface for a data annotation tool. The UI should allow users to input a high-level goal, view a generated TAS plan, and then edit, approve, or reject the plan.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': "Develop the front-end and back-end for the data annotation tool based on Aurora's designs. Ensure the tool can store and export the validated dataset in the required JSON format."}, {'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': 'Engineer a set of system prompts for an LLM to be integrated into the annotation tool. These prompts will guide the LLM to generate accurate TAS plans from user-submitted high-level goals.'}, {'name': 'TASe', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'task': 'Utilize the annotation tool to generate and validate a dataset of at least 500 entries. Focus on quality, ensuring each TAS plan is logical, complete, and correctly structured.'}, {'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': 'Perform a final quality assurance check on the entire dataset. Sanitize the data, verify schema compliance for all entries, and prepare the final dataset file for the fine-tuning process.'}]}

Please use the following outputs from the other agents as your input:
