    "reasoning": "The high-level goal is to create 'Porn projects, under the La Metta Hood'. This requires a structured approach to define the project, generate tasks, and integrate deliverables. The plan will start by defining the core components of the project using the 'Tool Descriptor' (implicitly, as we are defining the tools themselves). Then, 'Task Generator' will break down the creation of these tools into actionable tasks for human engineers. Finally, 'Deliverable Integrator' will ensure these tasks are cohesively brought together. The roles provided (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe as TAS extractors and Qwen3-WebDev as a Web Developer) will be leveraged within these stages. The TAS extractors will help in identifying the fundamental steps needed to define and build the tools, while Qwen3-WebDev will be responsible for the web development aspects as they arise in the task generation phase.",
