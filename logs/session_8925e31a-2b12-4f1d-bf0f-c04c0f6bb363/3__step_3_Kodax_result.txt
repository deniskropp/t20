  "review_of_wireframes": {
    "technical_feasibility": "The wireframes are technically feasible. The 'Main Interaction View' is a standard pattern for conversational UIs and can be built with modern frontend frameworks. The 'Settings View' as a modal is also a common and manageable pattern. The accessibility considerations mentioned are crucial and align with best practices for web development. Potential challenges include optimizing scroll performance in the chat area with many messages, ensuring cross-browser consistency, managing application state efficiently, and implementing robust focus management for the modal.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Utilize a component-based architecture for modularity and reusability (e.g., `MessageBubble`, `InputForm`).",
      "Consider virtualization libraries (e.g., `react-window`) for the `ChatArea` if a very long message history is anticipated, to optimize performance.",
      "Implement the `SettingsView` as a modal component for better user experience and context preservation.",
      "Ensure all interactive elements have clear focus states as per accessibility guidelines."

    "framework_selection": {
      "framework": "React",
      "reasoning": "React is chosen for its component-based architecture, which is ideal for building modular and maintainable UIs like this AI frontend. Its extensive ecosystem, strong community support, and declarative nature facilitate efficient development of dynamic and interactive applications. It also provides excellent tools and patterns for building responsive and accessible web applications."
