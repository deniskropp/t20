    "overall_assessment": "The implementation of the AI frontend website demonstrates a strong foundation, closely aligning with the established high-fidelity mockups and design system. Key components are in place, and the integration of the AI system's API is underway. The primary focus for refinement lies in enhancing accessibility features, particularly concerning dynamic content updates and modal interactions, and in performing a comprehensive audit of color contrast and responsiveness across various devices. The adherence to the defined microcopy and overall aesthetic is commendable.",

      {
        "component_name": "Header",
        "alignment_with_mockups": "The Header component accurately reflects the mockups, displaying the application title and a functional settings button. The visual styling adheres to the design system's specifications.",
        "accessibility_compliance": "Good. Logo accessibility attributes (alt text/ARIA label) require verification. The settings button correctly utilizes the 'Open settings' ARIA label and exhibits clear focus states.",
        "recommendations": [
          "Verify the implementation of accessibility attributes for the logo.",
          "Ensure consistent and visible focus states for the settings button."

        "component_name": "ChatArea & MessageBubble",
        "alignment_with_mockups": "The ChatArea and MessageBubble components effectively render messages, distinguishing user and AI content with appropriate styling and alignment. The loading indicator is correctly implemented.",
        "accessibility_compliance": "Needs improvement. The absence of ARIA live regions for new messages means screen reader users may not be automatically notified of updates. Keyboard navigation for scrolling the chat history requires explicit confirmation. The focusability of individual message bubbles and their focus states also need verification.",
        "recommendations": [
          "Implement ARIA live regions for the `ChatArea` to announce new messages dynamically.",
          "Ensure robust keyboard navigation for scrolling within the `ChatArea`.",

        "alignment_with_mockups": "The InputForm, comprising the TextInput and Send Button, aligns well with the mockups. It correctly uses the defined microcopy for placeholders and button text.",
        "accessibility_compliance": "Good. The TextInput component correctly employs the `ariaLabel` prop. The Send Button is focusable, has clear states, and supports keyboard submission.",
        "recommendations": [
          "Ensure the TextInput component's associated label is correctly implemented, even if visually hidden, for semantic completeness."

        "alignment_with_mockups": "The SettingsModal adheres to the mockup's structure, including form controls and action buttons. The application of microcopy for labels and buttons is accurate.",
        "accessibility_compliance": "Requires significant attention. While focus trapping and modal dismissal via the Escape key are implemented, rigorous testing is needed to ensure focus never escapes the modal and returns correctly to the triggering element upon closure. All form elements must have properly associated accessible labels.",
        "recommendations": [
          "Conduct thorough testing of focus trapping and return behavior.",
          "Verify all form elements within the modal have accessible labels.",

        "accessibility_compliance": "Good. Focus states are generally applied, and semantic elements are used. Consistency across all instances needs verification.",
        "recommendations": [
          "Ensure focus states are consistently and clearly visible for all instances of these reusable components."

          "Perform a detailed accessibility audit focusing on color contrast ratios across all UI elements."

    "overall_accessibility_status": "Fair. While foundational accessibility features are present, critical areas like ARIA live regions for dynamic content and robust modal accessibility require immediate attention and refinement.",
    "responsiveness_status": "Good. The use of flexbox and max-width suggests a solid responsive foundation. However, final cross-device and cross-browser testing is recommended to validate behavior across all target environments.",
    "actionable_insights_for_next_steps": [
      "Prioritize the implementation of ARIA live regions for dynamic message updates in the `ChatArea`.",
