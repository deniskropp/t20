    "role_goal": "Implement designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.",
    "review_of_wireframes": {
      "technical_feasibility": "The wireframes for the 'Main Interaction View' and 'Settings View (Modal)' are technically feasible. The proposed layout, elements, and user interaction flow are standard patterns in modern web development and are well-suited for implementation with a robust frontend framework. The accessibility considerations outlined (focus states, color contrast, labels, keyboard navigation, modal accessibility) are critical and achievable with careful implementation.",
      "potential_challenges": [
        "Ensuring smooth and performant scrolling for the 'Chat/Response Area', especially with a large volume of messages, might require optimization techniques like virtualization.",
        "Implementing robust focus management for the 'Settings Modal' to ensure keyboard traps and correct focus return upon closing.",
        "Maintaining consistent UI rendering and behavior across a variety of browsers and devices, particularly concerning responsiveness.",
        "Efficiently managing the application's state, including conversation history, user input, loading states, and settings, as complexity grows.",
        "Designing an accessible and informative loading indicator for AI responses."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Adopt a component-based architecture for modularity and reusability. Key components identified include Header, ChatArea, MessageBubble, InputForm, Button, and TextInput. The SettingsModal should also be a distinct, reusable component.",
        "For the 'Chat/Response Area', consider using a virtualized list library (e.g., `react-window` or `react-virtualized`) to optimize rendering performance if a very long message history is anticipated.",
        "The 'Settings View' should be implemented as a modal component to preserve user context and provide a focused interaction, with special attention to accessibility.",
        "Prioritize the implementation of ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates within the 'Chat/Response Area' to ensure screen reader compatibility."

Its extensive ecosystem, strong community support, and declarative nature facilitate the creation of dynamic and interactive UIs. It also provides excellent tools and patterns for building responsive and accessible web applications, which are critical for this project. The availability of libraries for virtualization and state management further supports its suitability."

The `src/utils/api.js` file will serve as the entry point for all backend communication, abstracting API logic."
