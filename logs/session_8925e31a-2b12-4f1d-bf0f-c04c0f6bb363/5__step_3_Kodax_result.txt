  "review_of_wireframes": {
    "technical_feasibility": "The wireframes are technically feasible. The 'Main Interaction View' is a standard conversational UI pattern, implementable with modern frontend frameworks. The 'Settings View' as a modal is also a common and manageable pattern. The accessibility considerations outlined (focus states, color contrast, labels, keyboard navigation, modal accessibility) are crucial and achievable with careful implementation. Potential challenges include optimizing scroll performance in the chat area with many messages, ensuring cross-browser consistency, managing application state efficiently, and implementing robust focus management for the modal.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Utilize a component-based architecture for modularity and reusability (e.g., `MessageBubble`, `InputForm`).",
      "Consider virtualization libraries (e.g., `react-window`) for the `ChatArea` if a very long message history is anticipated, to optimize performance.",
      "Implement the `SettingsView` as a modal component for better user experience and context preservation, with special attention to accessibility.",
      "Prioritize the implementation of ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates within the 'Chat/Response Area' to ensure screen reader compatibility."

    "framework_selection": {
      "framework": "React",
      "reasoning": "React is chosen for its component-based architecture, which aligns perfectly with the modular design requirements and the need for reusable UI elements. Its extensive ecosystem, strong community support, and declarative nature facilitate the creation of dynamic and interactive UIs. It also provides excellent tools and patterns for building responsive and accessible web applications, which are critical for this project. The availability of libraries for virtualization and state management further supports its suitability."

The `src/utils/api.js` file will serve as the entry point for all backend communication, abstracting API logic."
