  "review_of_wireframes": {
    "technical_feasibility": "The wireframes presented are technically feasible. The 'Main Interaction View' is a standard conversational UI pattern, implementable with modern frontend frameworks. The optional 'Settings View' as a modal is also a common and manageable pattern. The outlined accessibility considerations are critical and align with web development best practices.",
    "potential_challenges": [
      "Ensuring smooth and performant scrolling in the 'Chat/Response Area', especially with a large message history.",
      "Maintaining consistent UI rendering and behavior across various browsers and devices.",
      "Efficiently managing the state for conversation history, current input, and AI loading status.",
      "Designing a clear and accessible loading indicator for AI responses that doesn't disrupt the user experience.",
      "Implementing robust focus management for the modal, ensuring keyboard accessibility and trapping focus within the modal."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Adopt a component-based architecture (e.g., for `MessageBubble`, `InputForm`, `Header`) to promote reusability and maintainability.",
      "For the 'Chat/Response Area', consider using a virtualized list library (like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`) if a very long message history is anticipated, to optimize rendering performance.",
      "The 'Settings View' should be implemented as a modal component to preserve user context and provide a focused interaction.",
      "Ensure all interactive elements have clear focus states as per accessibility guidelines."

  "project_structure_setup": {
    "framework_selection": {
      "framework": "React",
      "reasoning": "React is chosen for its component-based architecture, which aligns perfectly with the modular design requirements. Its extensive ecosystem, strong community support, and declarative nature facilitate the creation of dynamic and interactive UIs. It also provides excellent tools and patterns for building responsive and accessible web applications, crucial for this project."
