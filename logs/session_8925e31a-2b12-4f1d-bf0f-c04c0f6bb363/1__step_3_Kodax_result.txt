  "review_of_wireframes": {
    "technical_feasibility": "The provided wireframes are technically feasible. The 'Main Interaction View' with its header, chat/response area, input area, and action button is a standard pattern for conversational interfaces and can be implemented using most modern frontend frameworks. The optional 'Settings View' as a modal is also a common and manageable pattern. The accessibility considerations mentioned are crucial and align with best practices for web development.",
    "potential_challenges": [
      "Implementing a smooth, performant scrolling experience for the 'Chat/Response Area', especially with a large number of messages.",
      "Ensuring consistent rendering and behavior of the chat interface across different browsers and devices.",
      "Managing the state of the conversation and user inputs efficiently.",
      "Designing a clear and accessible loading indicator for AI responses."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Consider a component-based architecture for reusability (e.g., a `MessageBubble` component, an `InputForm` component).",
      "For the chat/response area, explore libraries that handle virtualized lists for performance if a very long history is anticipated.",
      "The 'Settings View' could be implemented as a modal component for better user experience and context preservation."

    "framework_selection": {
      "framework": "React",
      "reasoning": "React is a popular, robust, and component-based JavaScript library well-suited for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces like this AI frontend. Its large ecosystem, strong community support, and declarative nature make it efficient for managing UI state and creating reusable components. It also has excellent support for building responsive and accessible applications."
