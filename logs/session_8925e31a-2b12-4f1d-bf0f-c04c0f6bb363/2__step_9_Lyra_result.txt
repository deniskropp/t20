    "overall_assessment": "End-to-end testing, simulated based on engineering implementation details and design review findings, indicates good progress with core functionalities and UI alignment. Key areas for further refinement and explicit verification include comprehensive accessibility (especially keyboard navigation for chat, and robust modal focus management), and a dedicated color contrast audit. The clarity of user instructions and the foundation for quality AI interaction (via prompt engineering and data passing) are largely in place, though actual AI behavior depends on the backend system.",
