    "overall_assessment": "The implemented frontend components largely align with the high-fidelity mockups and the established design system. Key areas for refinement focus on enhancing accessibility, particularly within the modal component and dynamic content updates, and ensuring consistent responsiveness across all viewports. The integration of microcopy and the adherence to the color palette and typography are commendable.",

      {
        "component_name": "Header",
        "alignment_with_mockups": "Good. Logo and title are rendered as specified. The proposed settings button functionality is present.",
        "accessibility_compliance": "Good. ARIA labels for the settings button are recommended. Logo needs confirmation of alt text or ARIA label implementation. Title contrast is sufficient.",
        "recommendations": [
          "Verify logo accessibility (alt text/ARIA label).",

        "alignment_with_mockups": "Good. Message distinction (user vs. AI) and general layout match mockups. Loading indicator is present.",
        "accessibility_compliance": "Needs improvement. ARIA live regions for new messages are crucial for screen reader users. Keyboard navigation for scrolling needs explicit confirmation. Focusability of message bubbles should be verified.",
        "recommendations": [
          "Implement ARIA live regions for new messages.",

        "recommendations": [
          "Thoroughly test focus trapping and return.",
          "Verify all form elements have accessible labels.",
