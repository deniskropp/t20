      "area": "Visual Alignment with Designs",
      "feedback": "The implemented components generally align well with the high-fidelity designs. Specifically, the `Header` and `Footer` components correctly incorporate the brand colors and layout principles. The `Input` and `TextArea` components reflect the specified border-radius and padding. However, the `Button` components need a slight adjustment to match the exact `border-radius` of '8px' as defined in the `component_styles` of the design system. The `accent` color for primary buttons should be applied consistently.",
      "recommendations": [
        "Verify and adjust the `border-radius` of all `Button` components to '8px'.",
        "Ensure the `accent` color ('Warm Sand', #E0C8A8) is used for primary button backgrounds.",
        "Confirm that the `Muted Ivory` (#F5F5DC) is used for `Card` and `Input` backgrounds, with the correct `border-radius` of '12px' for cards and '8px' for inputs."
      ],
      "severity": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "area": "User Flow and Interaction Logic",
      "feedback": "The core interaction loop appears to be implemented, with the `MainAIWorkspacePage` handling input and displaying output. The integration of `react-router-dom` for navigation between pages is confirmed. However, the 'Save' functionality for AI output is noted as a placeholder. The direct re-population of the workspace from history items needs to be confirmed for smooth iteration.",
      "recommendations": [
        "Prioritize the implementation of the 'Save' functionality, ensuring it correctly calls the history endpoint or a local storage mechanism.",
        "Thoroughly test the user flow for iterating on AI responses: after receiving an output, can the user easily modify the prompt and re-generate? Does selecting a history item correctly pre-fill the workspace?",
        "Ensure that error states for API calls are clearly communicated to the user, using the `notification_error` style as defined."
      ],
      "severity": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "area": "Accessibility Standards",
      "feedback": "Initial accessibility features have been considered, such as the use of semantic HTML and placeholder considerations for ARIA attributes. However, a detailed review of keyboard navigation and focus management is required. Specifically, focus indicators for interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) need to be clearly visible and consistent across all components. The `aria-label` for icon-only buttons in the `Header` and `Footer` (if any) should be checked.",
      "recommendations": [
        "Conduct a thorough keyboard navigation audit: ensure all interactive elements are focusable via Tab and can be activated with Enter/Space.",
        "Verify that focus indicators are distinct and meet contrast requirements (e.g., using the `secondary` or `accent` color with a clear outline).",
        "Ensure all `Icon` components used as standalone interactive elements (e.g., in the header/footer for navigation or actions) have appropriate `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes.",
        "Confirm that the `LoadingSpinner` is accessible, potentially using `aria-live` to announce loading status changes to screen readers."

      "severity": "High"
    },
    {
      "area": "Component Reusability and Consistency",
      "feedback": "The plan outlines the creation of reusable components, which is excellent. However, consistency in prop naming and usage across components should be maintained. For instance, how `onClick` handlers are passed and managed should be uniform.",
      "recommendations": [
        "Standardize prop names for common functionalities like `onClick`, `label`, `isDisabled`, and `variant` across all button and input components.",
        "Ensure consistent application of spacing units (from `spacing_scale`) within and between components for visual harmony."
      ],
      "severity": "Low"
    },
    {
      "area": "API Integration Logic",
      "feedback": "The integration plan covers the core API calls for generation and history. The handling of `model_id` and `parameters` mapping needs careful implementation to ensure it aligns with the flexibility described in the API contract, especially if dynamic parameter configurations are supported for different models.",
      "recommendations": [
        "Implement robust error handling within `apiService.ts` to catch specific API error codes (`INVALID_PROMPT`, `MODEL_UNAVAILABLE`, etc.) and translate them into user-friendly messages on the frontend.",
        "Develop a clear strategy for managing the `model_id` selection and its corresponding parameter controls. This might involve a mapping object or a dynamic component rendering approach.",
        "Ensure that the `user_context` object, including `session_id`, is correctly populated and sent with relevant API requests."
      ],
      "severity": "Medium"
    }
  ],
  "overall_assessment": "The implementation is progressing well, laying a solid foundation for the AI frontend. Key areas for immediate attention are ensuring visual fidelity to the design system, particularly with button styles, and conducting a thorough accessibility audit focused on keyboard navigation and focus management. The integration logic for API calls and state management is sound, but requires diligent error handling and careful parameter mapping.",
  "next_steps": [
    "Address the visual alignment issues for Button components.",
    "Conduct the detailed accessibility audit and implement necessary fixes.",
    "Refine the 'Save' functionality and test iterative user flows.",
    "Implement robust error handling and model parameter management in API integration."
