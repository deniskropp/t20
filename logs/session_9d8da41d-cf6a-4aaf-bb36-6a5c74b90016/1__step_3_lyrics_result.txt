  "output": "## Finalized Lyrics for Hardstyle Anthem\n\n**Theme:** Unleashing primal energy and achieving a state of euphoric transcendence through intense, driving force.\n**Emotional Tone:** Aggressive, determined, powerful, euphoric, transcendent.\n\n**(Intro - Instrumental/Atmospheric)**\n\n**(Verse 1)**\nShadows cling, a silent hold,\nA story waiting to unfold.\nBeneath the calm, a pressure builds,\nA sleeping giant, fate fulfills.\nChains of doubt begin to fray,\nDarkness yields to dawning day.\nA pulse awakens, deep inside,\nNowhere left for fear to hide.\n\n**(Pre-Chorus)**\nFeel the rhythm start to climb,\nLeaving yesterday behind.\nIgnite the fire, feed the flame,\nWhispering your destined name!\n\n**(Chorus - \"THE SURGE\")**\nUNBOUND! THE ROAR OF THUNDER,\nFIRE BURNS, TEARING ASUNDER!\nETERNAL FORCE, IT STARTS RIGHT NOW!\nTHIS IS THE POWER, TAKE A BOW!\nUNLEASHED! THE PRIMAL URGE,\nON THIS HIGHWAY, WE CONVERGE!\n\n**(Verse 2)**\nVision sharp, the world transforms,\nThrough sonic light, escaping storms.\nBeyond the veil, a clarity,\nConnected to infinity.\nThe pulse is high, a cosmic dance,\nLost within this pure expanse.\n\n**(Pre-Chorus)**\nFeel the rhythm start to climb,\nLeaving yesterday behind.\nIgnite the fire, feed the flame,\nShouting out your destined name!\n\n**(Chorus - \"THE SURGE\")**\nUNBOUND! THE ROAR OF THUNDER,\nFIRE BURNS, TEARING ASUNDER!\nETERNAL FORCE, IT STARTS RIGHT NOW!\nTHIS IS THE POWER, TAKE A BOW!\nUNLEASHED! THE PRIMAL URGE,\nON THIS HIGHWAY, WE CONVERGE!\n\n**(Bridge)**\nResonance begins to spread,\nEchoes live, though words unsaid.\nSpirit soaring, still alive,\nThrough this energy, we thrive.\n\n**(Build-up - Instrumental)**\n\n**(Outro / Final Chorus - \"THE SURGE\")**\nUNBOUND! THE ROAR OF THUNDER,\nFIRE BURNS, TEARING ASUNDER!\nETERNAL FORCE, IT STARTS RIGHT NOW!\nTHIS IS THE POWER, TAKE A BOW!\nUNLEASHED! THE PRIMAL URGE,\nON THIS HIGHWAY, WE CONVERGE!\n(Fade out with sustained energy and echoes)",
