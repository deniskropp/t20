        "prompt": "Generate an epic hardstyle anthem that embodies the theme of 'Unleashing primal energy and achieving a state of euphoric transcendence through intense, driving force.' The emotional tone should be a powerful fusion of aggression, determination, euphoria, and raw power.\n\n**Lyrical Content:**\n\n**(Intro - Instrumental/Atmospheric)**\n\n**(Verse 1)**\nShadows cling, a silent hold,\nA story waiting to unfold.\nBeneath the calm, a pressure builds,\nA sleeping giant, fate fulfills.\nChains of doubt begin to fray,\nDarkness yields to dawning day.\nA pulse awakens, deep inside,\nNowhere left for fear to hide.\n\n**(Pre-Chorus)**\nFeel the rhythm start to climb,\nLeaving yesterday behind.\nIgnite the fire, feed the flame,\nWhispering your destined name!\n\n**(Chorus - \"THE SURGE\")**\nUNBOUND! THE ROAR OF THUNDER,\nFIRE BURNS, TEARING ASUNDER!\nETERNAL FORCE, IT STARTS RIGHT NOW!\nTHIS IS THE POWER, TAKE A BOW!\nUNLEASHED! THE PRIMAL URGE,\nON THIS HIGHWAY, WE CONVERGE!\n\n**(Verse 2)**\nVision sharp, the world transforms,\nThrough sonic light, escaping storms.\nBeyond the veil, a clarity,\nConnected to infinity.\nThe pulse is high, a cosmic dance,\nLost within this pure expanse.\n\n**(Pre-Chorus)**\nFeel the rhythm start to climb,\nLeaving yesterday behind.\nIgnite the fire, feed the flame,\nShouting out your destined name!\n\n**(Chorus - \"THE SURGE\")**\nUNBOUND! THE ROAR OF THUNDER,\nFIRE BURNS, TEARING ASUNDER!\nETERNAL FORCE, IT STARTS RIGHT NOW!\nTHIS IS THE POWER, TAKE A BOW!\nUNLEASHED! THE PRIMAL URGE,\nON THIS HIGHWAY, WE CONVERGE!\n\n**(Bridge)**\nResonance begins to spread,\nEchoes live, though words unsaid.\nSpirit soaring, still alive,\nThrough this energy, we thrive.\n\n**(Build-up - Instrumental)**\n\n**(Outro / Final Chorus - \"THE SURGE\")**\nUNBOUND! THE ROAR OF THUNDER,\nFIRE BURNS, TEARING ASUNDER!\nETERNAL FORCE, IT STARTS RIGHT NOW!\nTHIS IS THE POWER, TAKE A BOW!\nUNLEASHED! THE PRIMAL URGE,\nON THIS HIGHWAY, WE CONVERGE!\n(Fade out with sustained energy and echoes)\n\n**Sonic Palette and Musical Arrangement:**\n\n*   **Genre:** Hardstyle Anthem\n*   **Tempo:** 150 BPM\n*   **Key Elements:**\n    *   **Synths:** Utilize sharp, distorted, aggressive lead synths with a prominent mid-range. Employ gritty, evolving pads with a sense of tension and power. Create powerful, driving chord progressions with resonant or slightly distorted qualities.\n    *   **Bassline:** A heavy, distorted, rhythmic sub-bass that locks tightly with the kick drum, providing a solid and aggressive low-end foundation.\n    *   **Kick Drum:** A classic hardstyle kick â€“ punchy, distorted, with a strong mid-range presence and a sharp, defined attack. It must cut through the mix with maximum impact.\n    *   **Percussion:** Crisp, energetic hi-hats and sharp, impactful snares. Incorporate additional percussive loops and hits to enhance the driving feel.\n*   **Overall Energy & Dynamics:** The track should be relentlessly high, aggressive, determined, and euphoric. Feature massive build-ups that create significant tension, followed by explosive, high-impact drops. The arrangement should include clear sections like intro, verses, pre-chorus (build-ups), choruses (drops), bridge, and an outro that maintains or fades out with sustained energy.\n*   **Sound Design:** Integrate risers, sweeps, and impactful impacts to enhance dynamic range and excitement. Utilize distortion and saturation across various elements to achieve the genre's characteristic aggression and loudness.",
