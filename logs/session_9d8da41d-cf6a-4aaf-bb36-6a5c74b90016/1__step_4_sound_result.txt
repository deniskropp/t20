  "output": "Define the sonic palette for the hardstyle anthem. This includes setting the tempo at a driving 150 BPM. Signature synth sounds should be sharp, distorted, and aggressive, with a focus on powerful leads and gritty, evolving pads. The bassline needs to be a heavy, distorted, and rhythmic sub-bass that locks in with the kick drum. The kick drum itself should be a classic hardstyle kick: punchy, distorted, with a strong mid-range presence and a defined attack, designed to cut through the mix. Percussion should be energetic and driving, with crisp hi-hats and snare hits. Overall energy should be relentlessly high, characterized by massive build-ups, impactful drops, and a euphoric, anthemic feel. Sound design elements should include risers, sweeps, and impactful impacts to enhance the dynamic range and excitement.",
