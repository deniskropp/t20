The overall goal is: 'Compile a prompt for creating an epic hardstyle anthem (lyrics and sound only)'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and return each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Extract Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) for generating lyrics and defining the sound of an epic hardstyle anthem based on the defined theme.'

The team's roles are:
    {'reasoning': "The user wants to create a prompt for an epic hardstyle anthem, focusing on lyrics and sound. This requires a structured approach, breaking down the goal into actionable steps for different AI agents. The plan will first define the theme and lyrics, then the music production, and finally, it will compile the prompt for these two aspects. The 'Prompt Engineer' will oversee the structuring and clarity, the 'TAS extractor' will identify the steps, and the 'lyrics' and 'sound' agents will be the primary executors for this specific request. The 'stream' agent is not directly involved in creating the prompt itself, but its role is acknowledged in the broader context of music production.", 'roles': [{'title': 'Prompt Engineer', 'description': 'Structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering.'}, {'title': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'description': "Identify and return each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal."}, {'title': 'Lyricist', 'description': 'Craft compelling and evocative lyrics for music.'}, {'title': 'Music Producer', 'description': 'Manage sound definition, music production, and audio engineering for music tracks.'}, {'title': 'Distribution and Promotion Agent', 'description': 'Manage digital distribution, music marketing, and audience engagement for music.'}], 'tasks': [{'task_id': 'T1', 'task': "Define the core theme, narrative, and emotional tone for an epic hardstyle anthem, focusing on concepts that resonate with the genre's energy and intensity.", 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'name': 'Lyra', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T2', 'task': 'Extract Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) for generating lyrics and defining the sound of an epic hardstyle anthem based on the defined theme.', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'uTASe', 'requires': ['T1']}, {'task_id': 'T3', 'task': 'Generate initial lyrical concepts and a narrative structure for the hardstyle anthem, aligning with the theme defined in T1.', 'role': 'Lyricist', 'name': 'lyrics', 'requires': ['T1', 'T2']}, {'task_id': 'T4', 'task': 'Refine and finalize the lyrics, ensuring they are impactful, memorable, and suitable for a hardstyle anthem.', 'role': 'Lyricist', 'name': 'lyrics', 'requires': ['T3']}, {'task_id': 'T5', 'task': 'Define the sonic palette for the hardstyle anthem, including key elements like tempo, BPM, signature synth sounds, basslines, kick drum characteristics, and overall energy.', 'role': 'Music Producer', 'name': 'sound', 'requires': ['T1', 'T2']}, {'task_id': 'T6', 'task': 'Develop a musical composition and arrangement that complements the lyrical themes and sonic palette, focusing on hardstyle genre conventions.', 'role': 'Music Producer', 'name': 'sound', 'requires': ['T4', 'T5']}, {'task_id': 'T7', 'task': 'Compile a comprehensive prompt for generating an epic hardstyle anthem, integrating the finalized lyrics (T4) and the defined sound elements (T5, T6).', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'name': 'Lyra', 'requires': ['T4', 'T6']}]}
