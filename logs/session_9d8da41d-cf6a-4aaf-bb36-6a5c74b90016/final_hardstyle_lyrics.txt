**(Intro - Instrumental/Atmospheric)**

**(Verse 1)**
Shadows cling, a silent hold,
A story waiting to unfold.
Beneath the calm, a pressure builds,
A sleeping giant, fate fulfills.
Chains of doubt begin to fray,
Darkness yields to dawning day.
A pulse awakens, deep inside,
Nowhere left for fear to hide.

**(Pre-Chorus)**
Feel the rhythm start to climb,
Leaving yesterday behind.
Ignite the fire, feed the flame,
Whispering your destined name!

**(Chorus - "THE SURGE")**
UNBOUND! THE ROAR OF THUNDER,
FIRE BURNS, TEARING ASUNDER!
ETERNAL FORCE, IT STARTS RIGHT NOW!
THIS IS THE POWER, TAKE A BOW!
UNLEASHED! THE PRIMAL URGE,
ON THIS HIGHWAY, WE CONVERGE!

**(Verse 2)**
Vision sharp, the world transforms,
Through sonic light, escaping storms.
Beyond the veil, a clarity,
Connected to infinity.
The pulse is high, a cosmic dance,
Lost within this pure expanse.

**(Pre-Chorus)**
Feel the rhythm start to climb,
Leaving yesterday behind.
Ignite the fire, feed the flame,
Shouting out your destined name!

**(Chorus - "THE SURGE")**
UNBOUND! THE ROAR OF THUNDER,
FIRE BURNS, TEARING ASUNDER!
ETERNAL FORCE, IT STARTS RIGHT NOW!
THIS IS THE POWER, TAKE A BOW!
UNLEASHED! THE PRIMAL URGE,
ON THIS HIGHWAY, WE CONVERGE!

**(Bridge)**
Resonance begins to spread,
Echoes live, though words unsaid.
Spirit soaring, still alive,
Through this energy, we thrive.

**(Build-up - Instrumental)**

**(Outro / Final Chorus - "THE SURGE")**
UNBOUND! THE ROAR OF THUNDER,
FIRE BURNS, TEARING ASUNDER!
ETERNAL FORCE, IT STARTS RIGHT NOW!
THIS IS THE POWER, TAKE A BOW!
UNLEASHED! THE PRIMAL URGE,
ON THIS HIGHWAY, WE CONVERGE!
(Fade out with sustained energy and echoes)
