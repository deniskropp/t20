  "output": "The consolidated and refined Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) for the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' looping execution plan are as follows. These steps aim to provide a structured and coherent workflow, ensuring clarity and efficiency for all agents involved.\n\n**1. Define Execution Scope**\n   - **Description:** Clearly delineate the boundaries and objectives of the looping execution process for 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz'. This involves understanding what constitutes a complete cycle and the desired outcome of each loop.\n   - **Purpose:** Establishes a clear understanding of what needs to be achieved within each iteration of the looping process, preventing scope creep and ensuring focus.\n   - **Keywords:** scope, definition, objectives, boundaries, looping\n   - **Applicability:** Essential for any process that involves repeated cycles or iterative development.\n   - **Inputs:** High-level goal for looping execution, List of components involved.\n   - **Outputs:** Documented scope statement, List of defined objectives per loop.\n\n**2. Map Interdependencies**\n   - **Description:** Identify and document the relationships and dependencies between different stages or components within the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' looping execution. This includes understanding how the output of one step informs the input of another.\n   - **Purpose:** Ensures a logical flow and efficient execution by understanding how each part of the process connects to others, preventing bottlenecks.\n   - **Keywords:** dependencies, interdependencies, mapping, workflow, relationships\n   - **Applicability:** Crucial for complex processes involving multiple actors or sequential steps.\n   - **Inputs:** Defined execution scope, List of components/tasks.\n   - **Outputs:** Dependency graph or matrix, Documented workflow sequence.\n\n**3. Define Loop Parameters**\n   - **Description:** Specify the conditions under which the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' execution loop will start, continue, and terminate. This includes defining trigger events, success/failure criteria for each loop iteration, and the overall number of iterations or duration.\n   - **Purpose:** Provides clear rules for the iterative process, ensuring predictable and controllable execution.\n   - **Keywords:** looping, iteration, parameters, conditions, termination, triggers\n   - **Applicability:** Applicable to any repetitive process, algorithm, or workflow.\n   - **Inputs:** Defined execution scope, Mapped interdependencies.\n   - **Outputs:** Set of defined loop parameters, Criteria for loop continuation and termination.\n\n**4. Identify Input Requirements per Stage**\n   - **Description:** For each stage within the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' loop, determine the specific inputs required from previous stages or external sources to proceed.\n   - **Purpose:** Ensures that all necessary data or conditions are available before initiating a task, preventing delays and errors.\n   - **Keywords:** inputs, requirements, data, dependencies, stage, component\n   - **Applicability:** Useful in any multi-step process where data or resources are passed between stages.\n   - **Inputs:** Mapped interdependencies, Defined execution scope.\n   - **Outputs:** List of input requirements for each stage/component.\n\n**5. Identify Output Specifications per Stage**\n   - **Description:** For each stage within the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' loop, define the expected outputs and their specifications. This clarifies what each stage should produce and in what format.\n   - **Purpose:** Ensures that the output of each stage is suitable for the next stage or for the overall goal, facilitating smooth transitions.\n   - **Keywords:** outputs, specifications, format, deliverables, stage, component\n   - **Applicability:** Important for structured processes where the result of one step is the input for another.\n   - **Inputs:** Mapped interdependencies, Defined execution scope.\n   - **Outputs:** List of output specifications for each stage/component.\n\nThese refined TAS form the backbone of the looping execution plan. They provide a clear, sequential, and comprehensive framework that will guide the subsequent tasks, including prompt generation, design, development, and execution.",
