  "evaluation_summary": "The current loop execution plan is well-structured with clear definitions of roles, tasks, and a cohesive design. However, it primarily outlines the *plan* rather than a fully implemented, dynamic execution system. Key areas for improvement include defining the actual execution engine, robust error handling, specific data contracts between agents, and a formalized feedback loop mechanism.",
