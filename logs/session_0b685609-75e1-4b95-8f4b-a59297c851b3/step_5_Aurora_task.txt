Your primary objective is to establish the foundational user experience and core visual identity.\n\nSpecifically, I need you to:\n\n1.  **Illustrate the Core User Flow for AI Interaction:**\n    *   Develop initial wireframes that clearly detail the end-to-end user journey when interacting with the AI. This includes:\n        *   User input methods (e.g., text field, voice command).\n        *   AI processing states (e.g., loading indicators, 'thinking' animations).\n        *   How AI responses are displayed (e.g., text bubbles, visual elements, data outputs).\n        *   Consider potential error states and how they are communicated.\n        *   Show how users can initiate new queries or continue existing conversations.\n\n2.  **Define the Core Visual Identity:**\n    *   Propose a foundational style guide that sets the aesthetic tone for the website. This should include:\n        *   A primary color palette (main colors, accent colors, and their emotional impact).\n        *   Recommended typography (primary and secondary fonts, considering readability and brand personality).\n        *   Initial thoughts on the overall aesthetic (e.g., modern, minimalist, futuristic, friendly, professional) that conveys intelligence, reliability, and user-friendliness.\n\nYour deliverables should be a set of conceptual wireframes illustrating the key user flows and a preliminary style guide document. This will serve as the essential blueprint for the AI frontend's UI/UX and visual direction."
