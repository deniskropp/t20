    "overall_impression": "The wireframes and style guide provide a solid foundation for the AI frontend. The user flow is logical, and the 'Nebula' color palette with 'Inter' and 'Roboto Mono' typography strikes a good balance between sophistication and usability. The aesthetic principles are well-defined.",
    "technical_feasibility": {
      "wireframes": "The proposed screens and elements are technically feasible. Standard chat interface components are well-understood and implementable. The 'AI Processing State' with a typing indicator is a common pattern that can be achieved with frontend state management and subtle animations. Error handling is also standard.",
      "style_guide": {
        "color_palette": "The color palette is feasible. Using a primary dark blue, secondary lavender, and gold accent is achievable with CSS variables. Accessibility considerations for contrast ratios should be kept in mind during implementation, especially with text on dark backgrounds.",
        "typography": "Using 'Inter' for primary text and 'Roboto Mono' for code/data is a good choice. Both are readily available via web fonts and offer excellent readability. The specified font sizes are standard and responsive adjustments will be straightforward.",
        "aesthetic": "The minimalist, futuristic, and intelligent aesthetic is achievable. Focus on clean CSS, well-defined spacing, and subtle animations will be key. The logo concept is also implementable with SVG or CSS art."

    "component_structure": {
      "chat_interface": "The chat interface can be broken down into modular components: `Header`, `MessageList` (which would contain `MessageBubble` for user and AI messages), `InputBar` (containing `TextInput` and `SendButton`), and a `MicrophoneButton`. The `ChatHistoryArea` will be the container for `MessageList`.",
      "processing_state": "This can be a conditional rendering within the `ChatInterface` or a separate component that overlays or replaces the `MessageList` temporarily, showing a `TypingIndicator`.",
      "error_handling": "Error messages can be rendered as a specific type of `MessageBubble` within the `MessageList`, or as a distinct notification component. The `RetryButton` would be part of this error display.",
      "style_guide_integration": "The style guide elements (colors, fonts) should be implemented using CSS custom properties (variables) for easy management and theming. Component styles should directly reference these variables."
    },
    "responsive_design_considerations": {
      "chat_interface": "The chat layout should adapt well. On smaller screens, the input area might take up more vertical space, and message bubbles may need to adjust their width. The chat history should be scrollable. The `MicrophoneButton` should be easily accessible.",
      "typography_scale": "The font sizes (`h1`, `h2`, `body_large`, etc.) will need responsive adjustments. For example, `h1` might be smaller on mobile, and `body_large` might become the default body font on smaller viewports.",
      "spacing_and_layout": "Whitespace and layout margins/paddings should be responsive. Flexbox and CSS Grid will be instrumental in creating flexible and adaptable layouts for different screen sizes. The `aesthetic.key_principles` mention ample whitespace, which is good for responsiveness.",
      "touch_targets": "Ensure buttons and interactive elements have sufficient touch target sizes on mobile devices."
    },
    "suggestions_for_next_steps": [
      "**Refine Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios, especially for text against background colors. Plan for keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes for interactive elements.",
      "**Component States:** Define more granular states for components (e.g., button hover, focus, active states; input field focus states).",
      "**Interaction Details:** Flesh out the exact behavior of the 'typing indicator' and transitions between states (e.g., from input to processing to response).",
      "**Scalability:** Consider how the chat history will perform with a very large number of messages. Virtualization might be needed for performance optimization.",
      "**Mobile-first approach:** While the current design is adaptable, explicitly thinking about mobile layouts first can ensure a robust responsive experience."
