  "retrospective_context": "The initial development of the AI frontend website is complete, with Aurora's final design and accessibility review confirming high fidelity and Kodax proceeding with final testing and deployment. We are now entering the 'Deploy and Iterate' phase, marking a shift from initial build to continuous improvement.",
  "prompt_for_utase": "uTASe,\n\nAs we reflect on the successful initial project delivery, it's time to chart the course for the AI frontend's ongoing evolution. Our goal is to establish a robust framework for future features and continuous improvements, moving beyond the initial deployment.\n\nBuilding upon the 'Deploy and Iterate' foundational phase you previously defined, and considering the insights from Aurora's final review (e.g., recommendations for further accessibility testing, performance monitoring, and user feedback integration, as well as Kodax's pending deployment activities),\n\nPlease outline the **next set of foundational, task-agnostic phases** specifically for the *iterative development and long-term enhancement* of the live AI frontend website. These phases should guide our ongoing efforts to refine, expand, and maintain the product based on real-world usage and evolving needs.\n\nFocus on deconstructing the 'Iterate' aspect into actionable, high-level phases. For each phase, provide:\n\n1.  **Name:** A concise title for the phase.\n2.  **Description:** A brief explanation of its purpose and activities.\n3.  **Purpose:** The strategic objective of this phase.\n4.  **Keywords:** Relevant terms associated with the phase.\n5.  **Typical Inputs:** What information or artifacts are needed to start this phase?\n6.  **Typical Outputs:** What are the expected deliverables or outcomes?\n\nThis will serve as our strategic blueprint for continuously improving the AI frontend after its initial launch."
