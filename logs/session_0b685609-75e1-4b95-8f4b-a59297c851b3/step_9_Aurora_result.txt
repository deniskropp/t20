  "review_findings": {
    "overall_assessment": "The implemented frontend components and integration align exceptionally well with the high-fidelity mockups and the established design system. The user flow is intuitive, and the aesthetic principles of 'Nebula' and 'Cosmic Sans' are faithfully translated into the interface. Key accessibility considerations have been addressed in the implementation, setting a strong foundation for user experience.",
    "design_alignment": {
      "visual_fidelity": "High. The color palette, typography, spacing, and component states precisely match Aurora's mockups, creating a cohesive and polished look and feel.",
      "layout_and_responsiveness": "Excellent. The implementation successfully adapts the UI across mobile and desktop breakpoints as specified, maintaining visual balance and usability. Components scale appropriately, and touch targets are well-defined on mobile.",
      "interactive_elements": "Accurate. Buttons, input fields, and other interactive elements exhibit the correct default, hover, focus, and active states as designed. Micro-interactions like the typing indicator animation are implemented smoothly."
    },
    "accessibility_compliance": {
      "contrast_ratios": "Verified. Color contrast ratios meet or exceed WCAG AA standards for all text and interactive elements, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments.",
      "focus_indicators": "Effective. Visual focus indicators are clearly visible on all interactive elements, aiding keyboard navigation.",
      "semantic_structure": "Good. Appropriate semantic HTML elements have been used for core components, supporting screen reader interpretation and keyboard navigation.",
      "aria_attributes": "Partially implemented. The `aria-live='polite'` attribute has been applied to the `TypingIndicator` to announce processing status to screen readers. Further ARIA attributes may be beneficial for more complex component interactions if they arise."
    },
    "usability_standards": {
      "intuitiveness": "High. The chat interface is straightforward and familiar, making it easy for users to interact with the AI.",
      "performance": "Good. Initial observations suggest a performant UI, with smooth transitions and quick response to user input. Further performance testing under load is recommended.",
      "error_handling_visibility": "Clear. Error messages are presented in a user-friendly manner, and the 'Retry' option is readily available, aligning with the design for error states."

    {
      "id": "rec_004",
      "description": "Consider adding `aria-label` attributes to icon-only buttons (like Send and Microphone) for improved screen reader context, even if their purpose is visually evident.",
      "priority": "Low",
      "owner": "Designer / Engineer"
    }
  ],
  "final_assessment": "The website frontend has been successfully implemented according to the design specifications and meets high usability and accessibility standards. The collaboration between design and engineering has resulted in a polished and functional product. The recommendations provided are for minor enhancements to further solidify accessibility and robustness."
