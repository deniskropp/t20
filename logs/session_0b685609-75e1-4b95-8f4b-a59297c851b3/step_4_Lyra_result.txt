  "prompt_for_aurora": "Aurora,\n\nYour initial wireframes and style guide were excellent and have been reviewed by Kodax, who confirmed their technical feasibility and provided insightful feedback for refinement.\n\nYour next critical task is to transform these foundational designs into **comprehensive, high-fidelity mockups** for the AI system frontend. These mockups must be aesthetically polished and fully optimized for technical implementation and user experience, incorporating all feedback.\n\nSpecifically, please provide:\n\n1.  **Detailed High-Fidelity Mockups for Key Screens & Components:**\n    *   Visually translate the established wireframes (Initial State, Processing, Response, Error) into pixel-perfect designs, applying the 'Nebula' color palette and 'Inter'/'Roboto Mono' typography with precision.\n    *   Design all individual UI components in their final, refined state, considering a modular structure (e.g., distinct designs for `Header`, `MessageList`, `InputBar`, `MessageBubble`, `TypingIndicator`, `RetryButton`).\n    *   **Illustrate All Interactive States:** For every interactive element (buttons, input fields, links, etc.), provide designs for their default, hover, focus, active, and disabled states.\n    *   **Define Micro-interactions & Transitions:** Clearly describe or visually represent the intended animations and subtle interactions, such as the AI 'typing indicator' behavior, message send/receive animations, and seamless state transitions.\n\n2.  **Enhanced Visual Identity & Full Accessibility Integration:**\n    *   Deepen the \"Minimalist, futuristic, and intelligent\" aesthetic through meticulous attention to detail, leveraging clean lines, ample whitespace, and subtle depth effects or gradients where appropriate.\n    *   **Embed Accessibility Best Practices:** Ensure the designs adhere to WCAG principles, specifically by:\n        *   Guaranteeing sufficient color contrast ratios for all text and interactive elements, addressing Kodax's note.\n        *   Providing clear and intuitive visual indicators for keyboard focus states.\n        *   Considering semantic structure and potential ARIA attributes for complex components.\n\n3.  **Comprehensive Responsive Design:**\n    *   Deliver high-fidelity mockups for **at least two critical breakpoints, with a mobile-first emphasis**:\n        *   **Mobile (e.g., ~375px - 414px width)**: Show the optimized layout and experience for smaller screens, ensuring touch target sizes are adequate.\n        *   **Desktop (e.g., ~1440px width)**: Demonstrate how the design scales elegantly, utilizing larger screen real estate effectively while maintaining consistency.\n    *   Clearly articulate how layout, typography (responsive scale), and interactive elements adapt across these views.\n\nYour output should be a complete set of high-fidelity mockups, providing a definitive visual blueprint for the AI frontend, ready for development."
