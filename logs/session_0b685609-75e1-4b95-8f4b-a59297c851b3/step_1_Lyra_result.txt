  "prompt_for_aurora": "Aurora,\n\nPlease initiate the design process for our AI system's frontend website, aligning with the 'Define Scope and Design' phase. Your primary objective is to establish the foundational user experience and core visual identity.\n\nSpecifically, I need you to:\n\n1.  **Illustrate the Core User Flow for AI Interaction:**\n    *   Develop initial wireframes that clearly detail the end-to-end user journey when interacting with the AI. This includes:\n        *   User input methods (e.g., text field, voice command).\n        *   AI processing states (e.g., loading indicators, 'thinking' animations).\n        *   How AI responses are displayed (e.g., text bubbles, visual elements, data outputs).\n        *   Consider potential error states and how they are communicated.\n        *   Show how users can initiate new queries or continue existing conversations.\n\n2.  **Define the Core Visual Identity:**\n    *   Propose a foundational style guide that sets the aesthetic tone for the website. This should include:\n        *   A primary color palette (main colors, accent colors, and their emotional impact).\n        *   Recommended typography (primary and secondary fonts, considering readability and brand personality).\n        *   Initial thoughts on the overall aesthetic (e.g., modern, minimalist, futuristic, friendly, professional) that conveys intelligence, reliability, and user-friendliness.\n\nYour deliverables should be a set of conceptual wireframes illustrating the key user flows and a preliminary style guide document. This will serve as the essential blueprint for the AI frontend's UI/UX and visual direction."
