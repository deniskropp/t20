The overall goal is: 'Image recognition based on a living example, given a databse with captioned images to recognize, leveraging tools were appropriate'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Deconstruct the high-level goal ('Image recognition based on a living example') into a detailed, sequential task plan for the team.'

The team's roles are:
    {'roles': [{'title': 'Designer', 'description': 'Generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.'}, {'title': 'Engineer', 'description': 'Implement designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.'}, {'title': 'Prompt Engineer', 'description': 'Structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering.'}, {'title': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'description': "Identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal."}], 'steps': [{'name': 'TASe', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'task': "Deconstruct the high-level goal ('Image recognition based on a living example') into a detailed, sequential task plan for the team."}, {'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': 'Design the core prompt engineering workflow for the image recognition model, defining how a live image will be analyzed and compared against the captioned image database.'}, {'name': 'Aurora', 'role': 'Designer', 'task': 'Design the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) flow, including the live image capture screen, result display, and user feedback mechanisms.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': 'Architect the overall system, select appropriate tools and frameworks, and set up the database schema for storing and efficiently querying the captioned images.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': "Develop the front-end application based on Aurora's UI/UX designs, ensuring a responsive and accessible user interface for image submission."}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': "Implement the back-end logic, including API endpoints, database integration, and the core image recognition service that utilizes Lyra's prompt workflow."}, {'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': 'Collaborate with Kodax to test, iterate, and refine the image recognition prompts based on real-world performance and testing data to improve accuracy.'}, {'name': 'Aurora', 'role': 'Designer', 'task': 'Conduct usability testing on the integrated prototype and provide feedback and design revisions to Kodax to enhance the user experience.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': 'Integrate all refined components (front-end, back-end, prompts), perform final testing, and deploy the complete image recognition application.'}, {'name': 'TASe', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'task': 'Document the final workflow, cataloging the executed steps, tools used, and outcomes to finalize the project plan.'}]}

Please execute your sub-task, keeping the overall goal and your role's specific goal in mind to ensure your output is relevant to the project.
