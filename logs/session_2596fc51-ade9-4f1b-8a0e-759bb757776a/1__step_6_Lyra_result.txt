    "title": "Enabling Real-World Prompt Testing and Refinement for Image Recognition",
    "context": "Kodax, your progress on architecting the system and implementing the backend logic, including the `mlEngineClient.js` and `recognitionService.js`, is well noted. These components correctly orchestrate the workflow for image recognition as defined by my prompts. However, the `mlEngineClient` currently uses mock responses for the AI model interactions. For me (Lyra, the Prompt Engineer) to effectively 'test, iterate, and refine the image recognition prompts based on real-world performance and testing data to improve accuracy,' we need to transition from these mocks to actual AI model execution.",
    "objective": "To enable comprehensive testing and iterative refinement of the image recognition prompts by integrating a live AI model and establishing robust data collection mechanisms for performance analysis and user feedback.",

        "description": "Replace the mock functions within `clients/mlEngineClient.js` (and any other relevant service layers) with actual calls to a deployed or locally running AI model. This model must be capable of executing the logic defined by Lyra's prompt workflow steps (Image Feature Extraction, Query Generation, Similarity Assessment, Recognition Decision).",
        "details": [
          "**For Step 1 (Live Image Feature Extraction and Description):** Implement the `analyzeImage` function to send the raw image data to a multimodal AI model (e.g., a fine-tuned CLIP or a large vision-language model) and retrieve its textual description, extracted keywords, and a high-dimensional image embedding vector. The output MUST adhere to the JSON schema defined in Lyra's `1_live_image_analysis` step.",
          "**For Step 2 (Database Query Generation):** Implement the `generateQuery` function to leverage the analysis results (especially keywords and the image embedding) to construct effective database queries. If the AI model can generate semantic query embeddings, utilize them. The output MUST adhere to Lyra's `2_database_query_generation` schema.",
          "**For Step 3 (Candidate Image Comparison and Similarity Scoring):** Implement the `assessSimilarity` function. This will involve comparing the live image's features (embedding, description, keywords) against the retrieved candidate images' data (embeddings, captions, keywords). This comparison should be performed by the AI model or a dedicated similarity scoring module. The output MUST adhere to Lyra's `3_similarity_assessment` schema, including accurate similarity scores and justifications.",
          "**For Step 4 (Final Recognition Decision and Confidence):** Implement the `makeDecision` function to apply the recognition and delta thresholds on the ranked similarity scores. This function should accurately determine if a confident match exists or if closest matches should be presented. The output MUST adhere to Lyra's `4_recognition_decision` schema.",
          "Ensure that the AI model outputs strictly conform to the JSON schemas provided in Lyra's prompt definitions. Any deviation will break the workflow."

    "collaboration_strategy": "Once these integrations are complete and we have initial real-world data and logs, I will analyze the system's performance. Based on this analysis (e.g., identifying patterns in incorrect recognitions, low confidence scores, or irrelevant query results), I will propose specific refinements to the prompt instructions, thresholds, or even the underlying AI model's interaction logic. We will then iterate by deploying these refined prompts and re-evaluating performance. This iterative process, driven by data and feedback, will be key to improving the overall accuracy of the image recognition system."
