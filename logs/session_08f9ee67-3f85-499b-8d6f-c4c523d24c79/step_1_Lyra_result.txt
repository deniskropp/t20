Your task is to design a layout that effectively communicates the key steps and their relationships within a system. You will be provided with a list of steps, each containing a name, description, and other relevant details. \n\nYour design should prioritize clarity and ease of understanding for a general audience. Consider using visual elements like diagrams, flowcharts, or other graphical representations to illustrate the flow of information and dependencies between steps. Use color, typography, and spacing to enhance readability and highlight key information. Ensure the design is modern, professional, and avoids unnecessary clutter.\n\nSpecifically, for each step, consider how to visually represent its:\n\n*   **Name:** Prominently display the name of the step.\n*   **Description:** Provide a concise and easily digestible summary of the step's purpose.\n*   **Category:** Indicate the category to which the step belongs (e.g., Problem Framing, Information Gathering).\n*   **Purpose:** Clearly state the objective of the step.\n*   **Keywords:** Use keywords to provide additional context and aid in understanding.\n*   **Typical Inputs:** Visually represent the inputs required for the step.\n*   **Typical Outputs:** Visually represent the outputs generated by the step.\n\nConsider using a consistent visual language throughout the design to maintain coherence and improve comprehension. The final output should be a detailed design specification, including layout, color scheme, typography, and any other relevant design elements. Provide a rationale for your design choices, explaining how they contribute to the overall clarity and effectiveness of the system overview.\n\nExample formats to consider (but are not limited to): flowcharts, process diagrams, information graphics, or a combination of these. Be creative and leverage your design expertise to create a compelling and informative visual representation of the system."
