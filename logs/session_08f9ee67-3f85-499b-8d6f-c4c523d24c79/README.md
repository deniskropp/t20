# System Overview Project

This project aims to create a clear, visually appealing, and accessible system overview. The process involves identifying core task-agnostic steps, designing a comprehensive layout, and implementing it with clean, responsive, and accessible code.

## Project Goals

*   **Identify Task-Agnostic Steps:** Deconstruct the high-level goal "System Overview" into fundamental, reusable actions.
*   **Design Visual Representation:** Create an aesthetically pleasing and easily understandable design for the system overview, including layout, color scheme, and typography.
*   **Implement Functional Overview:** Translate the design into functional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that is responsive and accessible.
*   **Ensure Clarity and Cohesion:** Refine all agent prompts and outputs to ensure clarity, consistency, and effective communication throughout the project lifecycle.

## Project Stages and Outputs

This project follows a structured workflow, with each stage building upon the previous one.

### Stage 1: Task-Agnostic Step Identification

*   **Role:** Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor
*   **Task:** Analyze the high-level goal "System Overview" to identify Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) required for its completion. TAS are steps that are generally applicable to any project.
*   **Output:** `step_0_TASe_result.txt` - A JSON array of identified Task Agnostic Steps, each with detailed descriptions, categories, purposes, and examples.

### Stage 2: Designer Prompt Refinement

*   **Role:** Prompt Engineer
*   **Task:** Refine the initial prompt for the Designer to generate a visually appealing layout for the system overview, emphasizing clarity and ease of understanding.
*   **Output:** `step_1_Lyra_result.txt` - A JSON object containing the refined prompt for the Designer.

### Stage 3: Design Generation

*   **Role:** Designer
*   **Task:** Generate a visually appealing layout for the system overview, including color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance. Consider the target audience and the information to be presented.
*   **Input:** Task Agnostic Steps identified in Stage 1, refined Designer prompt from Stage 2.
*   **Output:** `step_2_Aurora_result.txt` - A JSON object containing the detailed design specification.

### Stage 4: Engineer Prompt Refinement

*   **Role:** Prompt Engineer
*   **Task:** Refine the prompt for the Engineer to implement the design, focusing on responsive design and accessibility standards.
*   **Input:** Design specification from Stage 3.
*   **Output:** `step_3_Lyra_result.txt` - A JSON object containing the refined prompt for the Engineer.

### Stage 5: Implementation

*   **Role:** Engineer
*   **Task:** Implement the design into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility. Ensure the code is well-documented and easy to maintain.
*   **Input:** Design specification from Stage 3, refined Engineer prompt from Stage 4.
*   **Output:**
    *   `gen/index.html`
    *   `gen/style.css`
    *   `gen/script.js`
    *   `step_4_Kodax_result.txt` (containing implementation details and deployment instructions)

### Stage 6: Final Prompt Review and Refinement

*   **Role:** Prompt Engineer
*   **Task:** Review all prompts used in the process and refine them for future use, ensuring clarity, conciseness, and effectiveness.
*   **Input:** All previous prompt and result artifacts.
*   **Output:** `step_5_Lyra_result.txt` - A JSON object containing the final refined prompts.

## Project Files

*   `initial_plan.json`: The initial plan outlining the project's stages and roles.
*   `README.md`: This document.
*   `step_0_TASe_result.txt`: Task Agnostic Steps identified by TASe.
*   `step_1_Lyra_result.txt`: Refined prompt for the Designer.
*   `step_2_Aurora_result.txt`: Design specification generated by Aurora.
*   `step_3_Lyra_result.txt`: Refined prompt for the Engineer.
*   `step_4_Kodax_result.txt`: Code implementation and deployment instructions by Kodax.
*   `step_5_Lyra_result.txt`: Final prompt refinements by Lyra.
*   `gen/`: Directory containing the implemented web application files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).

## Deployment and Usage

1.  Navigate to the `gen/` directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

No web server is required as the application is purely client-side.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For semantic structure of the system overview.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout, responsiveness, and theming, utilizing CSS variables for consistency.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla):** For dynamic generation of the system overview elements and managing interactivity.

**Justification for not using a framework:** The design specification is straightforward and can be effectively implemented using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This approach minimizes dependencies, reduces bundle size, and leads to faster loading times and easier maintenance for this specific project.
