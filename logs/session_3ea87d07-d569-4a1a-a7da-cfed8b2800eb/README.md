# Refactoring Project Documentation

This repository outlines the process of refactoring a system, focusing on design, code, and user experience improvements. The project involves a collaborative effort between specialized AI agents: Lyra (Prompt Engineer), TASe (Task-Agnostic Step extractor), Aurora (Designer), and Kodax (Engineer).

## Project Goal

The overarching goal of this project is **'refactoring'**. This encompasses improving the existing system's design, code, and overall user experience by addressing aspects such as usability, accessibility, performance, modularity, and maintainability.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured, iterative approach defined by Lyra, the Prompt Engineer, to ensure seamless collaboration and clear communication among agents. The core phases involve:

1.  **Planning:** Defining the overall scope and outlining the collaborative plan.
2.  **Task Agnostic Step Extraction:** Identifying fundamental, reusable steps for the refactoring process.
3.  **Prompt Engineering:** Refining prompts for each agent to ensure clarity, specificity, and alignment with project goals.
4.  **Design Analysis and Proposal:** Aurora analyzes the existing design and proposes improvements.
5.  **Code Analysis and Planning:** Kodax analyzes the existing codebase and plans for refactoring.
6.  **Design Implementation:** Aurora creates UI flows and mockups based on the engineering analysis.
7.  **Code Implementation:** Kodax implements the design changes and refactored code.
8.  **Continuous Refinement:** Lyra continuously evaluates and refines prompts and workflows based on agent outputs and project progress.

## Agents and Roles

*   **Lyra (Prompt Engineer):** Responsible for analyzing agent outputs, refining prompts, structuring workflows, ensuring clarity in agent instructions, managing vocabulary, and driving iterative improvements. Lyra's goal is to facilitate effective collaboration between Aurora and Kodax.
*   **TASe (Task-Agnostic Step Extractor):** Responsible for identifying and extracting 'Task Agnostic Steps' (TAS) that represent fundamental actions required for the high-level goal. TASe's goal is to provide a foundational set of abstract steps for any refactoring effort.
*   **Aurora (Designer):** Responsible for generating aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance. Aurora's goal is to translate user needs and business goals into intuitive and engaging interfaces.
*   **Kodax (Engineer):** Responsible for implementing designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility. Kodax's goal is to ensure the technical feasibility and optimal performance of the refactored system.

## Key Refactoring Areas

The refactoring process addresses the following critical areas:

*   **Design:**
    *   Visual Balance and Hierarchy
    *   Whitespace and Layout Consistency
    *   UI Flows and Navigation
    *   Color Palettes (Accessibility-focused)
    *   Typography
*   **Code:**
    *   Modularity and Reusability
    *   Performance Optimization
    *   Responsiveness
    *   Maintainability (Coding Style, Documentation)
*   **User Experience:**
    *   Usability and Intuitiveness
    *   Accessibility (WCAG compliance)
    *   Feedback Mechanisms

## Project Workflow and Outputs

The project progresses through a series of steps, with each agent contributing specific artifacts. The outputs from each step are used as inputs for subsequent steps, creating a collaborative feedback loop.

### Step 0: Initial Planning (Lyra)

Lyra defines the initial plan, outlining the roles, high-level goal, and the collaborative workflow.

### Step 1: Task Agnostic Step Extraction (TASe)

TASe analyzes the high-level goal "refactoring" and extracts fundamental, reusable steps. These steps form the theoretical backbone of the refactoring process, independent of specific tools or domains.

*   **Output:** `step_1_TASe_result.txt` (JSON array of Task Agnostic Step objects)

### Step 2: Initial Prompt Refinement (Lyra)

Lyra analyzes the high-level goal and Lyra's initial output to refine the prompts for Aurora and Kodax, focusing on clarity, specificity, and the core refactoring objectives.

*   **Output:** `step_2_Lyra_result.txt` (JSON object with target agent and new prompt)

### Step 3: Design Analysis and Proposal (Aurora)

Aurora analyzes the existing design, identifying issues in visual balance, accessibility, and UI flows. Aurora then proposes updated layouts, color palettes, and typography options.

*   **Input:** `step_0_Lyra_result.txt`, `step_1_TASe_result.txt`
*   **Output:** `step_3_Aurora_result.txt` (JSON object detailing design analysis and proposals)

### Step 4: Code Analysis and Planning (Kodax)

Kodax analyzes the existing codebase, identifying issues in modularity, performance, responsiveness, accessibility, and maintainability. Kodax then outlines a refactoring plan and prioritizes tasks.

*   **Input:** `step_0_Lyra_result.txt`, `step_1_TASe_result.txt`
*   **Output:** `step_4_Kodax_result.txt` (JSON object with code analysis and refactoring plan)

### Step 5: UI Flows and Mockups (Aurora)

Leveraging Kodax's code analysis, Aurora creates detailed UI flows and mockups that reflect the refactored code structure and improved performance, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.

*   **Input:** `step_0_Lyra_result.txt`, `step_1_TASe_result.txt`, `step_2_Lyra_result.txt` (updated prompt for Aurora), `step_3_Aurora_result.txt`, `step_4_Kodax_result.txt`
*   **Output:** `step_5_Aurora_result.txt` (JSON object detailing UI flows and mockups)

### Step 6: Code Implementation (Kodax)

Kodax implements the designs provided by Aurora and the refactoring plan derived from the code analysis. This involves writing clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility, and conducting thorough testing.

*   **Input:** `step_0_Lyra_result.txt`, `step_1_TASe_result.txt`, `step_2_Lyra_result.txt` (updated prompt for Kodax), `step_3_Aurora_result.txt`, `step_4_Kodax_result.txt`, `step_5_Aurora_result.txt`
*   **Output:** `step_6_Kodax_result.txt` (JSON object with the implementation plan)

### Step 7: Iterative Prompt and Workflow Refinement (Lyra)

Lyra reviews all previous outputs to evaluate the effectiveness of the prompts and workflows. Lyra then updates the prompts and workflow structure to improve efficiency and effectiveness for future refactoring efforts, reinforcing vocabulary and validation loops.

*   **Input:** All previous step artifacts.
*   **Output:** `step_7_Lyra_result.txt` (JSON object with refined prompts for all agents)
