# Backend Implementation Plan for 'Porn projects, under the La Metta Hood'

## Role: Engineer (Kodax)

## Task: Implement the back-end logic and infrastructure for the 'Porn projects' platform.

## Inputs:
*   Consolidated TAS (from Fizz La Metta)
*   Prompt Engineer's system prompts (from Lyra)
*   Designer's specifications (from Aurora)
*   Front-end code structure (from Qwen3-WebDev)

## Overall Goal: 'Porn projects, under the La Metta Hood'

## Role's Specific Goal: 'Implement designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.'

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:

1.  **Technology Stack Selection:**
    *   **Language/Framework:** Node.js with Express.js for its flexibility, performance, and large ecosystem.
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL for its robustness, scalability, and support for complex queries. Alternatively, MongoDB could be considered for schema flexibility if project needs evolve towards more unstructured data.
    *   **API:** RESTful API design for communication between front-end and back-end.
    *   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
    *   **Deployment:** Docker for containerization, enabling consistent deployment across environments. Cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for hosting.

2.  **Database Schema Design:**
    *   **Projects Table:** `id`, `title`, `description`, `imageUrl`, `projectUrl`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    *   **Tags Table:** `id`, `name`.
    *   **Project_Tags (Junction Table):** `project_id`, `tag_id` (Many-to-Many relationship).
    *   **Considerations:** Indexing for performance, data types, constraints.

3.  **API Endpoint Development (RESTful):**
    *   **Projects:**
        *   `GET /api/projects`: Retrieve a list of all projects (with pagination and filtering options).
        *   `GET /api/projects/:id`: Retrieve a single project by ID.
        *   `POST /api/projects`: Create a new project (requires admin authentication).
        *   `PUT /api/projects/:id`: Update an existing project (requires admin authentication).
        *   `DELETE /api/projects/:id`: Delete a project (requires admin authentication).
    *   **Tags:**
        *   `GET /api/tags`: Retrieve a list of all tags.
        *   `POST /api/tags`: Create a new tag (requires admin authentication).
    *   **Authentication:**
        *   `POST /api/auth/login`: User login, returns JWT.
        *   `POST /api/auth/register`: User registration (if applicable).

4.  **Core Logic Implementation:**
    *   **Project Management:** CRUD operations for projects, including handling image uploads (storing metadata, possibly using a cloud storage service like AWS S3).
    *   **Tagging System:** Associating tags with projects, filtering projects by tags.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Middleware to protect routes requiring authentication and specific roles (e.g., admin).

5.  **Security Considerations:**
    *   Input validation to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).
    *   Secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
    *   Rate limiting for API endpoints.
    *   HTTPS for secure communication.
    *   Environment variables for sensitive configurations.

6.  **Scalability and Performance:**
    *   Asynchronous operations using Node.js event loop.
    *   Database connection pooling.
    *   Efficient query optimization.
    *   Caching mechanisms where appropriate.
    *   Consideration for microservices if the platform grows significantly.

7.  **Infrastructure and Deployment:**
    *   Set up Dockerfiles for the Node.js application and PostgreSQL database.
    *   Configure a cloud hosting provider.
    *   Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

8.  **Testing:**
    *   Unit tests for individual functions and modules (e.g., using Jest).
    *   Integration tests for API endpoints.
    *   End-to-end tests (potentially coordinated with front-end testing).

## Deliverables:
*   Backend API code (Node.js/Express.js)
*   Database schema definition (SQL for PostgreSQL)
*   Dockerfiles for deployment
*   Basic API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Next Steps:
*   Begin with Technology Stack Selection and Database Schema Design.
*   Iteratively develop API endpoints and core logic.
*   Implement security measures and testing throughout the development process.
