    "reasoning": "The high-level goal is to create 'Porn projects, under the La Metta Hood'. This requires a structured approach involving several specialized roles. The plan begins with identifying core components and tasks using the 'Task Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' agents. These steps are then refined and assigned to specific roles like Prompt Engineer, Designer, Web Developer, and Engineer for implementation. Finally, roles like Lyricist, Music Designer, and Distribution and Promotion Agent are involved for the creative and distribution aspects of the 'projects'. The Coordinator (Fizz La Metta) oversees the entire process, ensuring alignment and collaboration.",
