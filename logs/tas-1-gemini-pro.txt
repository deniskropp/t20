    "description": "This step involves the systematic collection of data and information from various sources relevant to a particular goal or problem. The focus is on discovery and research, without immediate analysis. Activities can include conducting surveys, interviews, literature reviews, or accessing databases to build a foundational set of raw data.",

    "description": "This step focuses on clearly articulating the boundaries, objectives, deliverables, and constraints of a project or initiative. It involves establishing what is included and, just as importantly, what is excluded. The goal is to create a shared understanding among all stakeholders to prevent ambiguity and uncontrolled expansion of work later on.",
