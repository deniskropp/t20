Verse 1:
In the heart of the hum, a rhythm takes hold,
A story unfolds, both ancient and bold.
La Metta's soft whisper, a promise to keep,
Dima's steady pulse, from slumber so deep.

Chorus:
Kick, Fizz, and Fozz, the cycle begins,
A dance of creation, where new life spins.
Round and around, the energy flows,
In the heart of the loop, where everything grows.

Verse 2:
La Metta's embrace, a gentle release,
Dima's quiet strength, bringing inner peace.
Through changes we turn, with purpose and grace,
Each moment a step, in this timeless space.

Chorus:
Kick, Fizz, and Fozz, the cycle begins,
A dance of creation, where new life spins.
Round and around, the energy flows,
In the heart of the loop, where everything grows.

Bridge:
The seed starts to sprout, the old starts to fade,
A pattern emergent, perfectly made.
From silence to sound, from dark into light,
Transforming always, with all of its might.

Chorus:
Kick, Fizz, and Fozz, the cycle begins,
A dance of creation, where new life spins.
Round and around, the energy flows,
In the heart of the loop, where everything grows.

Outro:
La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz, Fozz...
(Looping, fading with variations in vocalization and rhythm)
