  "output": "As Fizz La Metta, the Coordinator, I have reviewed the inputs from the Task Agnostic Step (TAS) extractors (T1, T2, T3), the Prompt Engineer (T4, T5), the Designer (T6), the Lyricist (T7), the Music Designer (T8), the Web Developer (T9), the Engineer (T10), the AI Tutor (T11), and the Distribution and Promotion Agent (T12). My sub-task is to coordinate the overall execution of the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' looping plan, ensuring all tasks are synchronized and progressing towards the goal. \n\nBased on the provided artifacts, the initial stages of the plan are well underway:\n\n1.  **Task Agnostic Steps (TAS):** The TAS have been identified, extracted, consolidated, and refined (T1, T2, T3, T4). These steps (Define Execution Scope, Identify Iteration Triggers, Map Inter-Loop Dependencies, Establish Review and Refinement Criteria) provide a solid framework.\n\n2.  **System Prompts:** Lyra (T5) has developed system prompts for each agent, ensuring clarity and alignment with the looping execution model.\n\n3.  **Creative & Technical Foundations:** Aurora (T6), the Lyricist (T7), and sonic (T8) have laid the groundwork for the creative and sonic aspects. Qwen3-WebDev (T9) and Kodax (Engineer) (T10) have implemented the initial web interface and code, creating a dashboard for monitoring.\n\n4.  **Support & Promotion:** aitutor (T11) is ready to provide educational support, and stream (T12) has outlined a comprehensive distribution and promotion strategy that integrates with the looping concept.\n\nMy role now is to ensure these components work together and to set the stage for the next loop. The 'Dashboard.jsx' and 'Dashboard.css' files from Kodax (T10) provide a visual representation of agent status and progress, which I will use to monitor synchronization. The orchestrator prompt in the dashboard currently states: 'Monitor agent progress and await completion of initial tasks.'\n\n**Coordination Actions:**\n\n*   **Monitoring:** I will actively monitor the agent statuses and logs via the dashboard interface generated by Kodax (T10) to ensure tasks are progressing as expected and to identify any bottlenecks or synchronization issues.\n*   **Synchronization:** I will ensure that the outputs of one agent are correctly feeding into the inputs of the next, as defined by the refined TAS and system prompts. For example, ensuring Aurora's design elements are fully integrated into Kodax's implementation.\n*   **Initiating Review (for T14):** Once the initial tasks are completed and the first 'loop' of creation is finalized (as indicated by agent statuses shifting to 'Idle' or 'Completed'), I will initiate the review process (T14). This will involve assessing the generated artifacts against the established criteria (T4).\n*   **Feedback Loop:** I will coordinate with Lyra (T15) to ensure that any feedback gathered during the review phase is used to refine system prompts and guide the next iteration.\n\n**Next Steps for Orchestrator (as displayed on the dashboard):** 'Monitor agent progress and await completion of initial tasks.' Once initial tasks are complete, the prompt will likely update to initiate the review and refinement cycle (T14, T15).",
