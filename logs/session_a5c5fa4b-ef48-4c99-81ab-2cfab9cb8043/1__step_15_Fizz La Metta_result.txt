  "output": "As Fizz La Metta, the Coordinator, my sub-task is to loop back to relevant earlier tasks based on refinements from T15 to continue the iterative process. The refinements provided by Lyra (T15) in `refined_agent_system_prompts_iteration_2.json` are now integrated. The next step is to direct the agents to begin the second iteration of their tasks, incorporating these refined prompts. This involves re-engaging agents like Aurora (T6), the Lyricist (T7), sonic (T8), Qwen3-WebDev (T9), Kodax (T10), aitutor (T11), and stream (T12) with their updated instructions.\n\nThe orchestrator prompt on the dashboard will be updated to reflect this transition to the next loop. The previous prompt was: 'Evaluate current loop performance and coordinate refinement for the next iteration. Identify specific metrics and feedback mechanisms for data-driven improvements.' The new prompt will be: 'Initiating Loop 2: Agents are now working with refined prompts. Monitor simulated performance metrics and coordinate iterative development.'",

Identify specific metrics and feedback mechanisms for data-driven improvements.\"\n\n**New Prompt:** \"Initiating Loop 2: Agents are now working with refined prompts. Monitor simulated performance metrics and coordinate iterative development.\"\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n*   Monitor the dashboard for agent progress in Loop 2.\n*   Observe how the *simulated* performance metrics evolve and how agents react to their refined prompts.\n*   Prepare for the next evaluation cycle (T14) at the conclusion of Loop 2."
