The overall goal is: 'Extract task agnostic steps'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Refine prompts, structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Develop a detailed, step-by-step methodology and set of instructions for systematically identifying and extracting task agnostic steps from various high-level goals, leveraging the defined criteria, data structure, and presentation guidelines.'

Please use the following outputs from the other agents as your input:
