# Project Title: Task Agnostic Steps Extractor

This project aims to identify, define, and structure "Task Agnostic Steps" (TAS) â€“ abstract, generalizable actions applicable across diverse domains. This will enable the creation of reusable process templates, facilitate automation, and simplify complex workflows.

## Project Goals:

*   **Define Task Agnostic Steps:** Establish a clear conceptual framework for what constitutes a Task Agnostic Step.
*   **Standardize Data Structure:** Create a machine-readable data structure (JSON schema) for representing TAS.
*   **Develop Presentation Guidelines:** Outline principles for clear, intuitive, and accessible presentation of TAS for human users.
*   **Build Extraction Methodology:** Design a systematic process for identifying and extracting TAS from high-level goals.
*   **Iteratively Refine:** Continuously improve the extraction methodology and criteria.

## Project Workflow:

The project progresses through distinct phases, with each agent contributing to the overall goal:

1.  **Conceptualization (Lyra - Prompt Engineer):** Lyra defines the core principles, characteristics, purpose, and identification criteria for Task Agnostic Steps, laying the foundational understanding for the project.
2.  **Data Structuring (Kodax - Engineer):** Kodax proposes a standardized JSON schema to ensure the extracted TAS are consistently formatted, machine-readable, and easily integrable.
3.  **Presentation Design (Aurora - Designer):** Aurora develops guidelines for presenting TAS in a clear, intuitive, and accessible manner, focusing on mobile UI, color palettes, typography, and user flow.
4.  **Methodology Development (Lyra - Prompt Engineer):** Lyra synthesizes the outputs from the previous steps to create a detailed, step-by-step methodology and instructions for extracting TAS, ensuring adherence to the conceptual framework, data structure, and presentation guidelines.
5.  **Refinement and Iteration (Lyra - Prompt Engineer):** Lyra refines the extraction methodology and criteria based on iterative testing and feedback, ensuring the extracted steps are truly agnostic, comprehensive, and meet all established standards.

## Key Artifacts:

*   **Conceptual Framework:** Defines Task Agnostic Steps, their properties, and how to identify them.
*   **JSON Schema:** Specifies the structure and requirements for each Task Agnostic Step object.
*   **Design Guidelines:** Outlines best practices for presenting Task Agnostic Steps to users.
*   **Extraction Methodology:** A detailed guide for systematically extracting Task Agnostic Steps.

## Team Roles:

*   **Lyra (Prompt Engineer):** Focuses on defining the conceptual framework, structuring workflows, and ensuring clarity in agent instructions and methodologies.
*   **Aurora (Designer):** Creates aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, prioritizing accessibility and visual balance.
*   **Kodax (Engineer):** Develops the data structure and implements designs into clean, modular, and performant code.

This collaborative approach ensures a comprehensive and robust system for identifying and managing Task Agnostic Steps.
