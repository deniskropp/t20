    "name": "Task Agnostic Steps",
    "definition": "Abstract, generalizable actions or decision points that are applicable across diverse tasks and domains, focusing on the 'how' of a process rather than the 'what' of a specific task.",
    "characteristics": [
      "Generality: Applicable across a wide range of tasks/domains.",
      "Reusability: Can be reused in different contexts without significant modification.",
      "Abstraction: Describes a higher-level action or pattern, devoid of specific implementation details or domain jargon.",
      "Action-Oriented: Represents a distinct, logical action or decision point.",
      "Independence: Not tied to the specific content, subject matter, or outcome of a particular task.",
      "Sequential Potential: Often forms part of a logical flow or process, contributing to a broader workflow."
    ],
    "purpose": [
      "To create reusable process templates and blueprints.",
      "To facilitate automation by identifying common, repeatable process patterns.",
      "To simplify complex workflows by abstracting and standardizing common elements.",
      "To improve efficiency, consistency, and predictability across different tasks and projects.",
      "To provide a foundational, universal vocabulary for process description and communication.",
      "To enable cross-domain knowledge transfer and problem-solving methodologies."
    ],
    "initial_identification_criteria": [
      "Does it describe an action that could be performed in multiple, seemingly unrelated tasks or industries?",
      "Is it free from domain-specific terminology, proper nouns, or highly specific details?",
      "Does it focus on the 'method' or 'approach' rather than the 'specific outcome' or 'subject matter'?",
      "Can it be expressed as a clear, concise verb-noun phrase (e.g., 'Gather Information', 'Analyze Data', 'Evaluate Options')?",
      "Does it represent a logical, self-contained unit of work or decision within a broader process?",
      "Could it be a step in a general problem-solving, project management, or design methodology?"
