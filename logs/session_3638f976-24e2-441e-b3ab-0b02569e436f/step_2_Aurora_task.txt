The overall goal is: 'Extract task agnostic steps'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Develop guidelines for the clear and intuitive presentation of the extracted task agnostic steps, focusing on readability, logical flow, and visual organization (even in a text-based format) to ensure they are easily comprehensible by human users.'

Please use the following outputs from the other agents as your input:

    "characteristics": [
      "Generality: Applicable across a wide range of tasks/domains.",
      "Reusability: Can be reused in different contexts without significant modification.",

      "Action-Oriented: Represents a distinct, logical action or decision point.",
      "Independence: Not tied to the specific content, subject matter, or outcome of a particular task.",
      "Sequential Potential: Often forms part of a logical flow or process, contributing to a broader workflow."

      "To create reusable process templates and blueprints.",
      "To facilitate automation by identifying common, repeatable process patterns.",
      "To simplify complex workflows by abstracting and standardizing common elements.",
      "To improve efficiency, consistency, and predictability across different tasks and projects.",

      "Does it describe an action that could be performed in multiple, seemingly unrelated tasks or industries?",
      "Is it free from domain-specific terminology, proper nouns, or highly specific details?",
      "Does it focus on the 'method' or 'approach' rather than the 'specific outcome' or 'subject matter'?",
      "Can it be expressed as a clear, concise verb-noun phrase (e.g., 'Gather Information', 'Analyze Data', 'Evaluate Options')?",
      "Does it represent a logical, self-contained unit of work or decision within a broader process?",
      "Could it be a step in a general problem-solving, project management, or design methodology?"
