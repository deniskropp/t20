            <dd>An autonomous entity within a Multi-Agent System (MAS) capable of perceiving its environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve its goals.</dd>

            <dt>Artifact</dt>
            <dd>The output or result produced by an agent during its execution. These can be data files, code snippets, text, or any other form of information.</dd>

            <dt>CLI (Command-Line Interface)</dt>
            <dd>A text-based interface used to operate software or systems via commands typed into a terminal.</dd>

            <dt>Context Passing</dt>
            <dd>The mechanism by which information and artifacts from previous agent actions are made available as input for subsequent actions, maintaining a coherent flow of data.</dd>

            <dt>Declarative Agent Definition</dt>
            <dd>Defining agent properties and behaviors through configuration files (like YAML) rather than imperative code, making them easier to manage and extend.</dd>

            <dt>Delegate Agent</dt>
            <dd>An agent in the T20 system that performs specific, specialized tasks delegated to it by the Orchestrator.</dd>
            
            <dt>Dynamic Planning</dt>
            <dd>The process by which the T20 system's Orchestrator generates an execution plan on-the-fly for each specific goal, adapting to the task's unique requirements.</dd>

            <dt>Gemini</dt>
            <dd>A family of multimodal large language models developed by Google, used to power the agents in the T20 system.</dd>

            <dt>Goal</dt>
            <dd>An objective that an agent or the system aims to achieve.</dd>
            
            <dt>High-Level Goal</dt>
            <dd>The initial, overarching objective provided by the user to the T20 system via the CLI.</dd>

            <dt>Interaction</dt>
            <dd>The communication or data exchange between agents within a Multi-Agent System.</dd>

            <dt>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</dt>
            <dd>A lightweight data-interchange format used by the T20 system for structuring dynamic plans.</dd>

            <dt>LLM (Large Language Model)</dt>
            <dd>A type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text, and performing various language-based tasks.</dd>

            <dt>Meta-Learning</dt>
            <dd>In the context of T20, refers to the system's ability to learn or adapt during execution, primarily through the Prompt Engineer agent's refinement of prompts.</dd>

            <dt>Multi-Agent System (MAS)</dt>
            <dd>A computational system comprised of multiple interacting, autonomous agents designed to solve problems collaboratively.</dd>

            <dt>Orchestrator</dt>
            <dd>The central agent (<code>Meta-AI</code>) in the T20 system responsible for planning, delegating tasks, and managing the overall workflow.</dd>

            <dt>Orchestrator-Delegate Model</dt>
            <dd>The architectural pattern used by T20, where a central Orchestrator coordinates specialized Delegate Agents.</dd>

            <dt>Pydantic</dt>
            <dd>A Python library used for data validation and parsing, employed in T20 to enforce the structure of AI-generated plans (JSON).</dd>

            <dt>Prompt Engineering</dt>
            <dd>The practice of carefully designing and refining the input prompts given to LLMs to elicit desired outputs and behaviors.</dd>

            <dt>Prompt Engineer Agent (<code>Lyra</code>)</dt>
            <dd>A specialized agent within T20 tasked with optimizing other agents' performance by refining their system prompts.</dd>

            <dt>Python</dt>
            <dd>An interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language used as the foundation for the T20 framework.</dd>

            <dt>Runtime</dt>
            <dd>The core Python code and modules that execute the T20 system's logic.</dd>

            <dt>Session</dt>
            <dd>A single, isolated execution run of the T20 system, characterized by its own directory containing all related artifacts and logs.</dd>

            <dt>Session Directory</dt>
            <dd>A dedicated folder created for each T20 run, storing the initial plan, agent outputs, logs, and other relevant artifacts.</dd>

            <dt>Stateful Session</dt>
            <dd>A session that maintains context and state across multiple steps and agent interactions.</dd>

            <dt>System Prompt</dt>
            <dd>The foundational instructions given to an LLM or agent that define its role, behavior, and constraints for a given task.</dd>

            <dt>TASe (Task-Agnostic Step Extractor)</dt>
            <dd>A specialized agent in T20 focused on identifying and defining reusable, task-agnostic steps for the system.</dd>
