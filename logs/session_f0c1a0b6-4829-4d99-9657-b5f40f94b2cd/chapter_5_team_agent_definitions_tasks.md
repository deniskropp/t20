# Chapter 5: The T20 Team: Agents in Detail - Task Breakdown

This document outlines the specific Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) required to write Chapter 5, 'The T20 Team: Agents in Detail', for the book about the T20 Multi-Agent System. This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of each agent within the T20 framework, detailing their roles, responsibilities, underlying models, and how they are defined.

## Task-Agnostic Steps for Chapter 5:

1.  **Gather Agent Information**
    *   **Description**: Collect detailed information about each agent in the T20 system, including their names, roles, core responsibilities, and the underlying models they utilize (e.g., `Meta-AI` as Orchestrator using `gemini-2.5-pro`).
    *   **Category**: Analysis
    *   **Purpose**: To ensure accuracy and completeness when describing the T20 team members.
    *   **Keywords**: agent details, team roles, model mapping, information gathering, T20 agents
    *   **Applicability Notes**: Essential for creating the 'Team' chapter content.
    *   **Examples of Usage**: Extracting agent names, roles, and model details from the `README.md` or agent configuration files.
    *   **Typical Inputs**: T20 system documentation (README), agent configuration files (YAML).
    *   **Typical Outputs**: A structured list or table of agent information.

2.  **Define Agent Roles and Responsibilities**
    *   **Description**: For each agent identified, clearly define its specific role within the T20 system and articulate its primary responsibilities and functions.
    *   **Category**: Synthesis
    *   **Purpose**: To provide readers with a clear understanding of each agent's contribution to the overall system workflow.
    *   **Keywords**: agent roles, responsibilities, functional definition, agent purpose, T20 team structure
    *   **Applicability Notes**: Key content for the 'Team' chapter.
    *   **Examples of Usage**: Describing `Meta-AI`'s role as Orchestrator, `Lyra`'s role as Prompt Engineer, `Aurora`'s role as Designer, etc.
    *   **Typical Inputs**: Structured list of agent information.
    *   **Typical Outputs**: Detailed descriptions of each agent's role and responsibilities.

3.  **Describe Underlying Models and Capabilities**
    *   **Description**: Detail the specific Large Language Models (LLMs) powering each agent (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`) and briefly explain the capabilities these models bring to the agent's function.
    *   **Category**: Synthesis
    *   **Purpose**: To provide technical context about the technology stack enabling each agent's performance.
    *   **Keywords**: LLM, models, capabilities, agent technology, Gemini, technical specifications
    *   **Applicability Notes**: Important for a technically-oriented chapter on agents.
    *   **Examples of Usage**: Mentioning that `Meta-AI` uses `gemini-2.5-pro` for complex planning, while `Aurora` uses `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` for design tasks.
    *   **Typical Inputs**: Structured list of agent information, including model assignments.
    *   **Typical Outputs**: Descriptions linking agents to their models and outlining associated capabilities.

4.  **Explain Agent Definition Mechanism**
    *   **Description**: Describe how agents are defined within the T20 system, focusing on the structure and content of their configuration files (e.g., YAML), including key fields like `name`, `role`, `goal`, and `model`.
    *   **Category**: Synthesis
    *   **Purpose**: To educate readers on the declarative nature of agent configuration and how new agents can be integrated.
    *   **Keywords**: agent definition, YAML configuration, structure, parameters, custom agents, extensibility
    *   **Applicability Notes**: Crucial for understanding agent customization and system extensibility.
    *   **Examples of Usage**: Explaining the typical fields in an agent's YAML file and how they map to agent behavior.
    *   **Typical Inputs**: Information on agent configuration files (from README or code).
    *   **Typical Outputs**: Explanation of the agent definition process and file structure.

5.  **Draft 'The Team' Chapter Content**
    *   **Description**: Compile and write the content for the chapter focusing on 'The Team' and 'Agent Definitions', integrating the information gathered and structured in the previous steps.
    *   **Category**: Execution
    *   **Purpose**: To produce the final written content for the specified chapter.
    *   **Keywords**: chapter writing, content creation, drafting, agent descriptions, team overview
    *   **Applicability Notes**: The primary task for this step, synthesizing all prior analysis.
    *   **Examples of Usage**: Writing section 5.1 'Meta-AI (Orchestrator)', 5.2 'Lyra (Prompt Engineer)', etc., using the gathered details.
    *   **Typical Inputs**: Information on agent roles, responsibilities, models, and definition mechanisms.
    *   **Typical Outputs**: The written draft of Chapter 5.
