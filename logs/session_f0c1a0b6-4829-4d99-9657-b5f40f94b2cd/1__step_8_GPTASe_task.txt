{"README.md": "Links: [MTC|LCP](https://ai.violass.club/mtc-lcp/)\n[Demo Logs](./logs)\n\n\n# T20 Multi-Agent System\n\nT20 is a sophisticated, multi-agent framework designed to tackle complex tasks through collaborative AI. It employs an orchestrator-delegate model where a primary \"Orchestrator\" agent dynamically creates a plan and delegates sub-tasks to a team of specialized agents, each powered by different models from the Google Gemini family.\n\nThe system is built for autonomy and traceability. Once given a high-level goal, the agents work together, passing context and artifacts between steps, until the objective is met. Every action, prompt, and output is saved in a distinct session directory for easy debugging and review.\n\n---\n\n## Core Concepts\n\nThe workflow of the T20 system follows a clear, powerful pattern:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The user provides a single, high-level goal via a command-line interface (e.g., \"Design a modern landing page for a new SaaS product\").\n2.  **Dynamic Planning**: The `Orchestrator` agent (Meta-AI) analyzes the goal and the capabilities of its team members. It then queries a powerful LLM (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) to generate a structured, step-by-step plan in JSON format. This plan outlines the roles and specific tasks required to achieve the goal.\n3.  **Task Delegation & Execution**: The `Orchestrator` proceeds through the plan, assigning each task to the appropriate specialized agent based on their role (e.g., a design task goes to `Aurora`, the Designer).\n4.  **Contextual Collaboration**: The output (artifact) of each step is saved and can be used as input for subsequent steps. This creates a chain of context, allowing agents to build upon each other's work.\n5.  **Meta-Learning & Adaptation**: A unique `Prompt Engineer` agent (Lyra) can be tasked with refining the system prompts of other agents *during* the workflow, optimizing their performance for the specific goal at hand.\n6.  **Session Logging**: The entire process\u2014from the initial plan to the final output\u2014is meticulously logged in a dedicated session folder, providing full transparency.\n\n## Features\n\n-   **Declarative Agent Definition**: Agents are defined in simple, easy-to-read YAML files.\n-   **Dynamic, AI-Generated Plans**: No hardcoded workflows. The Orchestrator creates a custom plan for every unique goal.\n-   **Role-Based Delegation**: Tasks are intelligently assigned to agents best suited for the job.\n-   **Structured LLM Outputs**: Utilizes JSON schema enforcement with Pydantic for reliable, machine-readable plans from the Orchestrator.\n-   **Stateful Sessions**: Each run is isolated in a session directory containing all artifacts, prompts, and results.\n-   **CLI-Driven**: Simple and straightforward to run from the command line.\n-   **Powered by Google Gemini**: Leverages a suite of Gemini models, from the highly capable `gemini-2.5-pro` for orchestration to the fast and efficient `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` for specialized tasks.\n\n## The Team\n\nThe system comes pre-configured with a team of specialized agents:\n\n| Name     | Role                        | Goal                                                                                         | Model                               |\n| :------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |\n| **Meta-AI**  | Orchestrator                | Orchestrate tasks, manage roles, and maintain shared context.                                | `gemini-2.5-pro`                    |\n| **Lyra**     | Prompt Engineer             | Structure workflows and refine agent instructions for clarity and effectiveness.             | `gemini-2.5-flash`                  |\n| **Aurora**   | Designer                    | Generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows.                        | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17` |\n| **Kodax**    | Engineer                    | Implement designs into clean, modular, and performant code.                                  | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17` |\n| **TASe**     | Task-Agnostic Step Extractor | Identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.            | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17` |\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nt20-multi-agent/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 agents/                 # YAML definitions for each agent\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 orchestrator.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 lyra.yaml\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 prompts/                # System prompts and instructions for agents\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 orchestrator_instructions.txt\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 runtime/                # Core Python source code for the framework\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 executor.py         # Main execution logic, agent classes, CLI entry point\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 loader.py           # Utilities for loading configs, agents, and prompts\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 sessions/               # Output directory for all runtime sessions (auto-generated)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 session_.../\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 initial_plan.json\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 0__step_0_Lyra_result.txt\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 setup.py                # Project setup and dependencies\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n-   Python 3.9+\n-   Git\n\n### Installation\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/your-username/t20-multi-agent.git\n    cd t20-multi-agent\n    ```\n\n2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv venv\n    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n    ```\n\n3.  **Install the package and its dependencies:**\n    This command uses the `setup.py` file to install the necessary libraries and make the `t20-cli` command available.\n    ```bash\n    pip install -e .\n    ```\n\n4.  **Set up your environment variables:**\n    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory and add your Google AI API key:\n    ```\n    # .env\n    GOOGLE_API_KEY=\"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"\n    ```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe framework is operated through the `t20-cli` command. Simply provide the high-level goal you want the agent team to accomplish as a string argument.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's ask the team to design and build a simple webpage.\n\n```bash\nt20-cli \"Design and create the HTML and CSS for a modern, minimalist landing page for a new SaaS product called 'Innovate'.\"\n```\n\n### What Happens Next\n\n1.  A new session is created in the `sessions/` directory.\n2.  `Meta-AI` (the Orchestrator) receives the goal and generates a plan, which is saved as `initial_plan.json`. The plan might look something like this:\n    -   **Step 1 (Prompt Engineer):** Refine the system prompts for the Designer and Engineer to align with a \"modern, minimalist\" aesthetic.\n    -   **Step 2 (Designer):** Generate a color palette, typography suggestions, and a layout description for the landing page.\n    -   **Step 3 (Engineer):** Take the design specifications from the Designer and write the complete HTML and CSS code.\n3.  The `Orchestrator` executes the plan step-by-step, calling the appropriate agents.\n4.  All intermediate and final outputs are saved as artifacts in the session folder. You can monitor the progress by watching the console output and exploring the generated files.\n\n```\nAfter the run is complete, you can find the final HTML and CSS code generated by `Kodax` inside the `sessions/session_<uuid>/` folder.\n```\n\nWrong, instead you get the last step's _task and _result in the session folder. Use these with Gemini, Qwen3-WebDev etc... they serve a highly-valuable purpose as templates!\n"}

  "output": "This introductory chapter will serve as the reader's entry point into the T20 Multi-Agent System. It will define what a multi-agent system is in general terms, then introduce the T20 system as a specific, powerful implementation. The chapter will clarify the book's purpose and scope, guiding readers on how to best utilize the material for their learning and application needs. It aims to provide a solid foundational understanding, setting the stage for deeper dives into the system's architecture, concepts, and practical usage in subsequent chapters.\n\n## Chapter 1: Introduction to T20 Multi-Agent System\n\n### 1.1 What is a Multi-Agent System (MAS)?\n\nA Multi-Agent System (MAS) is a computational system composed of multiple interacting, intelligent agents. These agents are autonomous entities capable of perceiving their environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve their individual or collective goals. Unlike monolithic systems, MAS leverages the power of collaboration, specialization, and distributed intelligence. Key concepts include:\n\n*   **Agents:** Autonomous entities with capabilities like perception, reasoning, and action.\n*   **Environment:** The context in which agents operate and interact.\n*   **Interaction:** The communication and coordination mechanisms between agents.\n*   **Goals:** Objectives that agents strive to achieve, which can be individual or shared.\n\nMAS frameworks are designed to tackle complex problems that are difficult or impossible to solve with a single, centralized agent, by distributing the workload and leveraging diverse capabilities.\n\n### 1.2 The T20 System: A Paradigm Shift\n\nThe T20 Multi-Agent System represents a significant advancement in practical MAS implementation. It moves beyond static, pre-defined workflows by employing an **Orchestrator-Delegate model**. At its core, T20 is designed for flexibility and dynamic problem-solving. When presented with a high-level goal, the system's `Orchestrator` agent (powered by `Meta-AI`) intelligently analyzes the objective and the available specialized agents. It then dynamically generates a tailored, step-by-step plan in a structured format (JSON), which is executed by delegating tasks to the most suitable agents.\n\nKey differentiators of T20 from traditional MAS frameworks include:\n\n*   **Dynamic, AI-Generated Plans:** T20 does not rely on hardcoded workflows. Each task is broken down and planned dynamically by an LLM, allowing for unique solutions to unique problems.\n*   **Meta-Learning and Prompt Engineering:** The system incorporates a dedicated `Prompt Engineer` agent (`Lyra`) that can refine system prompts during runtime, optimizing agent performance on the fly.\n*   **Traceability and Statefulness:** Every action, prompt, and artifact is meticulously logged within isolated session directories, ensuring full transparency and enabling easy debugging and review.\n*   **Declarative Agent Definitions:** Agents are defined using simple YAML files, making it easy to understand, manage, and extend the agent team.\n\n### 1.3 Target Audience and Book Scope\n\nThis book is intended for a diverse audience, including:\n\n*   **Software Developers:** Seeking to understand and implement advanced agent-based systems.\n*   **AI Researchers:** Interested in state-of-the-art MAS architectures and dynamic planning.\n*   **System Architects:** Looking for robust frameworks for complex, automated task execution.\n*   **Project Managers:** Aiming to leverage AI agents for efficient workflow automation.\n\nThe scope of this book encompasses a comprehensive exploration of the T20 Multi-Agent System. We will cover its foundational concepts, detailed architecture, the roles and capabilities of its core agents, installation and usage instructions, advanced application scenarios, and methods for customization and contribution. While we will touch upon the underlying principles of multi-agent systems, this book focuses specifically on the practical implementation and utilization of the T20 framework. It is not intended as a general treatise on AI or MAS theory, but rather as a practical guide to mastering the T20 system.",

      "content": "# Chapter 2: Core Concepts and Architecture\n\n## 2.1 The Orchestrator-Delegate Model\n\nThe T20 system operates on a sophisticated **Orchestrator-Delegate model**. This architecture is central to its dynamic planning and execution capabilities. The **Orchestrator** agent, primarily `Meta-AI`, serves as the brain of the operation. Its core responsibilities include:\n\n*   **Goal Analysis:** Interpreting the high-level user goal.\n*   **Plan Generation:** Dynamically creating a step-by-step plan, often in JSON format, outlining the tasks required to achieve the goal.\n*   **Task Delegation:** Assigning specific sub-tasks to the most appropriate specialized agents (delegates) based on their defined roles and capabilities.\n*   **Context Management:** Ensuring that the output and context from one step are correctly passed to the next.\n\nThe **Delegate Agents** are specialized entities, each designed to perform a specific set of tasks. Examples include `Aurora` for design, `Kodax` for engineering, and `TASe` for step extraction. They receive tasks from the Orchestrator, execute them, and return their outputs (artifacts) back to the Orchestrator or the next agent in the sequence.\n\n## 2.2 Agent Definition and Capabilities\n\nAgents within the T20 system are defined in a clear and accessible manner using **YAML files**. These configuration files specify crucial aspects of each agent, enabling the Orchestrator to understand and utilize them effectively. Key elements defined in an agent's YAML configuration include:\n\n*   **`name`**: A unique identifier for the agent (e.g., `Meta-AI`, `Aurora`).\n*   **`role`**: The primary function or expertise of the agent (e.g., `Orchestrator`, `Designer`).\n*   **`goal`**: A brief description of the agent's overarching objective within the system.\n*   **`model`**: The specific Large Language Model (LLM) powering the agent (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`). This dictates the agent's underlying capabilities and performance characteristics.\n\nThese declarative definitions allow the T20 system to be highly configurable and extensible, making it straightforward to add new agents with different specializations or to swap out underlying models.\n\n## 2.3 Dynamic Planning Mechanism\n\nA cornerstone of the T20 system is its **Dynamic Planning Mechanism**. Unlike rigid, pre-programmed workflows, T20 generates plans on-the-fly for each unique goal. This process typically involves:\n\n1.  **Orchestrator Interpretation:** The `Meta-AI` agent analyzes the user's high-level goal.\n2.  **LLM-Powered Planning:** The Orchestrator queries a powerful LLM (like `gemini-2.5-pro`) to break down the goal into a sequence of actionable steps.\n3.  **Structured Plan Output:** The generated plan is structured, often in JSON format, detailing the sequence of tasks, the agents responsible for each task, and any dependencies.\n*   **Schema Enforcement:** The system utilizes **Pydantic** for schema enforcement, ensuring that the plans generated by the LLM are reliable, machine-readable, and adhere to a predefined structure. This prevents errors and ensures smooth execution.\n\nThis dynamic approach allows T20 to adapt to a wide variety of tasks without requiring manual workflow configuration for each new objective.\n\n## 2.4 Contextual Collaboration and Artifact Passing\n\nEffective collaboration between agents is facilitated through **Contextual Collaboration** and **Artifact Passing**. As the Orchestrator executes the plan, the output of each agent's task is treated as an **artifact**. These artifacts represent the tangible results of an agent's work (e.g., generated code, design descriptions, extracted information).\n\n*   **Stateful Sessions:** Each run of the T20 system is contained within a dedicated **session directory**. This directory stores all artifacts, prompts, and logs generated during that specific execution.\n*   **Context Chaining:** Artifacts produced by one agent are made available as inputs for subsequent agents. This creates a chain of context, allowing agents to build upon each other's work seamlessly. For example, design specifications generated by `Aurora` can be passed to `Kodax` for implementation.\n\nThis mechanism ensures that information flows correctly through the system, maintaining a coherent state and enabling complex, multi-step task completion.\n\n## 2.5 Meta-Learning and Prompt Engineering (`Lyra`)\n\nThe T20 system includes a unique agent, `Lyra`, the **Prompt Engineer**. `Lyra`'s role is to enhance the performance and effectiveness of other agents by refining their system prompts *during* the workflow execution. This **Meta-Learning** capability allows the system to:\n\n*   **Adapt Prompts:** Adjust prompts based on the specific task, intermediate results, or desired output quality.\n*   **Optimize Performance:** Improve the accuracy, creativity, or efficiency of agent responses.\n*   **Ensure Consistency:** Maintain a consistent tone and adherence to instructions across different agents and tasks.\n\nBy dynamically optimizing prompts, `Lyra` contributes significantly to the overall robustness and adaptability of the T20 system.\n\n## 2.6 Session Logging and Traceability\n\n**Session Logging** is a fundamental feature of the T20 system, providing unparalleled **Traceability**. Every aspect of an execution run is meticulously recorded within the session directory:\n\n*   **Initial Goal:** The original user input.\n*   **Initial Plan:** The AI-generated plan (`initial_plan.json`).\n*   **Agent Prompts:** The exact prompts sent to each agent.\n*   **Agent Outputs:** The artifacts (results) generated by each agent.\n*   **Execution Logs:** Detailed logs of agent actions and system operations.\n\nThe structure of these session directories (e.g., `sessions/session_<uuid>/`) makes it easy to locate and review specific runs. This detailed logging is crucial for:\n\n*   **Debugging:** Identifying the root cause of errors or unexpected behavior.\n*   **Auditing:** Understanding the complete decision-making process.\n*   **Learning:** Analyzing how the system tackled specific problems to improve future interactions.\n\nThis commitment to transparency and traceability ensures that users can fully understand and trust the T20 system's operations."

It covers the necessary prerequisites, guides through the installation process, details environment setup, and walks the user through their first execution of the T20 CLI. The aim is to make the initial setup and usage as smooth and straightforward as possible, enabling users to quickly leverage the system's capabilities.\n\n## 3.1 Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin installing and using the T20 system, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:\n\n*   **Python:** Version 3.9 or higher is required. You can check your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.\n*   **Git:** Essential for cloning the T20 repository from its source. If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).\n\nWhile not strictly required, having a basic understanding of command-line interfaces (CLI) and virtual environments will be beneficial.\n\n## 3.2 Installation Guide\n\nFollow these steps to install the T20 Multi-Agent System:\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project and clone the repository using Git:\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/your-username/t20-multi-agent.git\n    cd t20-multi-agent\n    ```\n    *Replace `https://github.com/your-username/t20-multi-agent.git` with the actual repository URL if it differs.*\n\n2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**\n    Using a virtual environment helps manage project dependencies and avoids conflicts with other Python projects.\n    *   **Create:**\n        ```bash\n        python -m venv venv\n        ```\n    *   **Activate:**\n        *   On macOS and Linux:\n            ```bash\n            source venv/bin/activate\n            ```\n        *   On Windows:\n            ```bash\n            venv\\Scripts\\activate\n            ```\n    Your terminal prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active (e.g., `(venv) your-prompt$`).\n\n3.  **Install the package and its dependencies:**\n    The T20 system is installed as an editable package using its `setup.py` file. This command installs the package and makes the `t20-cli` command available in your activated environment.\n    ```bash\n    pip install -e .\n    ```\n\n## 3.3 Environment Setup\n\nTo utilize the T20 system, you need to provide your Google AI API key. This key is used by the agents to access the Google Gemini models.\n\n1.  **Create a `.env` file:**\n    In the root directory of the cloned `t20-multi-agent` project (the same directory where `setup.py` is located), create a new file named `.env`.\n\n2.  **Add your API Key:**\n    Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add your Google AI API key in the following format:\n    ```dotenv\n    # .env\n    GOOGLE_API_KEY=\"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"\n    ```\n    *Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key obtained from Google AI Studio or a similar service.*\n\n3.  **Verify Installation (Optional but Recommended):**\n    After installation and setting up the `.env` file, you can perform a quick check to ensure the CLI command is accessible:\n    ```bash\n    t20-cli --help\n    ```\n    If the command is found and displays help information, your installation is likely successful.\n\n## 3.4 Your First T20 Run\n\nNow that the T20 system is installed and configured, let's run a simple example to see it in action. We'll use the command-line interface (`t20-cli`) to ask the system to design and create a basic webpage.\n\nExecute the following command in your terminal from the root directory of the project:\n\n```bash\nt20-cli \"Design and create the HTML and CSS for a modern, minimalist landing page for a new SaaS product called 'Innovate'.\"\n```\n\n**What happens during this run:**\n\n1.  **Session Creation:** The T20 system automatically creates a new session directory within the `sessions/` folder (e.g., `sessions/session_abc123...`). This directory isolates the run's artifacts and logs.\n2.  **Goal Processing:** The `Meta-AI` (Orchestrator) agent receives your high-level goal.\n3.  **Dynamic Plan Generation:** `Meta-AI` consults an LLM (like `gemini-2.5-pro`) to generate a step-by-step execution plan in JSON format. This plan outlines the tasks and the agents responsible for them. The plan is saved as `initial_plan.json` in the session directory.\n4.  **Task Delegation and Execution:** The Orchestrator proceeds through the plan, delegating tasks. For instance:\n    *   `Lyra` might refine prompts for the design and coding agents.\n    *   `Aurora` (Designer) might generate design specifications (color palette, layout).\n    *   `Kodax` (Engineer) might then use these specifications to write the HTML and CSS code.\n5.  **Artifact Saving:** The output of each agent's task (e.g., design descriptions, code snippets) is saved as an artifact within the session directory.\n\n**Monitoring Progress:**\nYou can follow the execution progress through the console output. After the run completes, you will find the final generated HTML and CSS code (and all intermediate artifacts) within the specific session folder.\n\nThis first run demonstrates the core T20 workflow: receiving a goal, dynamically planning, delegating to specialized agents, and producing output artifacts, all while maintaining a traceable session log."

It will also provide guidance on debugging and troubleshooting common issues encountered when working with the system. The aim is to empower users to leverage the full potential of T20 for complex task automation.\n\n## 4.1 Basic Usage Patterns\n\nThe T20 system is primarily operated through its Command-Line Interface (CLI), `t20-cli`. The fundamental interaction involves providing a high-level goal as a string argument.\n\n### Crafting Effective High-Level Goals\n\nThe quality and specificity of your goal directly influence the outcome. Aim for clarity and provide enough context for the Orchestrator (`Meta-AI`) to understand the desired end state.\n\n*   **Be Specific:** Instead of \"Make a webpage,\" try \"Design and create the HTML and CSS for a modern, minimalist landing page for a new SaaS product called 'Innovate'.\"\n*   **Define Constraints:** If there are specific requirements (e.g., color palette, technology stack), include them.\n*   **State the Objective:** Clearly articulate what the final output should be.\n\n### Interpreting CLI Output\n\nWhen you run `t20-cli <your_goal>`, the system provides real-time feedback:\n\n*   **Session Information:** It will indicate the creation of a new session directory (e.g., `sessions/session_xyz...`).\n*   **Agent Actions:** You'll see which agent is currently performing a task (e.g., \"Meta-AI is planning...\", \"Aurora is generating design...\", \"Kodax is coding...\").\n*   **Artifacts:** You might see notifications about generated artifacts being saved.\n*   **Completion:** A message indicating the successful completion of the task or any errors encountered.\n\nUnderstanding this output helps you track the progress and identify potential bottlenecks or issues.\n\n## 4.2 Exploring Session Artifacts\n\nEach run of the T20 system generates a dedicated session directory (e.g., `sessions/session_xyz...`) containing all the artifacts produced during the execution. These artifacts are invaluable for understanding the system's process and for debugging.\n\n### Navigating Session Directories\n\nEach session folder typically contains:\n\n*   **`initial_plan.json`:** The structured plan generated by the Orchestrator, detailing the sequence of tasks and agent assignments.\n*   **Agent Output Files:** Files named according to the step and agent (e.g., `0__step_0_Lyra_result.txt`, `1__step_1_Aurora_result.md`). These contain the direct output of each agent's execution.\n*   **Log Files:** Detailed logs capturing the interactions, prompts, and system operations.\n\n### Analyzing Key Artifacts\n\n*   **`initial_plan.json`:** Review this to understand how the Orchestrator decomposed your goal. It shows the logic and steps the system intended to follow.\n*   **Agent Results:** Examine the output files from each agent. For example, `Aurora`'s output might contain design descriptions, color palettes, and layout ideas, while `Kodax`'s output would be the generated code.\n*   **Logs:** Use logs to trace the flow of information, identify specific prompts sent to agents, and diagnose errors if the process fails.\n\n## 4.3 Advanced Scenarios\n\nThe T20 system's flexibility allows for sophisticated applications beyond simple tasks.\n\n### Complex Goal Decomposition\n\nFor highly complex goals, the Orchestrator's dynamic planning is crucial. You might see plans with many steps, involving multiple iterations or conditional logic (though explicit conditional logic in the plan structure itself might depend on future enhancements).\n\n*   **Example:** \"Develop a full-stack web application for a task management system, including user authentication, task creation, progress tracking, and a responsive UI.\"\n    This would likely result in a multi-step plan involving agents for requirements analysis, database design, backend API development, frontend implementation, and testing.\n\n### Leveraging `Lyra` for Prompt Optimization\n\n`Lyra`, the Prompt Engineer agent, can dynamically refine system prompts to improve agent performance. While this is often handled automatically, understanding this capability is key:\n\n*   **Scenario:** If `Aurora` (Designer) is not producing designs that align with a \"modern minimalist\" aesthetic, `Lyra` might adjust the system prompt given to `Aurora` to emphasize these qualities more strongly in subsequent steps or reruns.\n*   **Customization:** Advanced users might explore ways to explicitly guide `Lyra` or configure its behavior for prompt optimization, although this typically involves deeper system modifications.\n\n### Customizing Agent Configurations\n\nAgents are defined in YAML files (e.g., `agents/designer.yaml`). You can customize these definitions to:\n\n*   **Change Underlying Models:** Swap `gemini-2.5-flash` with another compatible model if needed.\n*   **Adjust Agent Goals:** Fine-tune the specific objectives of an agent.\n*   **Modify Prompts:** Directly edit the default system prompts associated with an agent (though `Lyra` can override these dynamically).\n\n*Example:* To use a different model for `Kodax`, you would edit its YAML file, changing the `model:` field.\n\n## 4.4 Debugging and Troubleshooting\n\nWhen things don't go as planned, the session artifacts are your best resource.\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n*   **API Key Errors:**\n    *   *Symptom:* Errors related to authentication or missing API keys.\n    *   *Solution:* Ensure your `.env` file is correctly formatted and contains a valid `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. Verify that the key is active.\n\n*   **Plan Generation Failures:**\n    *   *Symptom:* The Orchestrator fails to create `initial_plan.json` or produces an invalid plan.\n    *   *Solution:* Check the Orchestrator's logs for specific error messages. The goal might be too complex, ambiguous, or require capabilities not understood by the planning LLM. Try simplifying the goal or providing more context.\n\n*   **Agent Execution Errors:**\n    *   *Symptom:* A specific agent fails during its task (e.g., `Kodax` produces broken code).\n    *   *Solution:* Examine the session logs and the output artifact for the failed agent. The error message might indicate issues with the input it received, limitations of its model, or problems with its prompt. Review the `initial_plan.json` to ensure the task delegation was appropriate.\n\n*   **Unexpected Output:**\n    *   *Symptom:* The final output doesn't meet expectations (e.g., suboptimal design, incorrect code logic).\n    *   *Solution:* Analyze the artifacts from preceding steps. Was the input to the final agent appropriate? Did `Lyra` optimize prompts effectively? Consider refining the initial goal or exploring agent configurations.\n\n### Using Session Logs for Debugging\n\nSession logs provide a chronological record of the system's execution. By tracing the prompts sent to agents and their responses, you can pinpoint where the process deviated or failed. Look for specific error messages, timeouts, or unexpected content in the logs to diagnose the problem.\n\nBy mastering these usage patterns and troubleshooting techniques, you can effectively harness the power of the T20 Multi-Agent System for a wide range of complex tasks."
