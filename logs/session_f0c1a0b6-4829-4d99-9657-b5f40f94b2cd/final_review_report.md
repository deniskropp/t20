**Date:** [Current Date]

## Summary of Completion:

I have completed the final review of the revised book content for the T20 Multi-Agent System. All edits, including the structural revisions between Chapters 2 and 5, the enhancements to examples in Chapter 4, and the specific textual corrections, have been incorporated as per the editor's feedback.

The content now meets the quality standards and reflects a clear, logical progression of information. The book is ready for the next stage of formatting for publication.

## Key Revisions Completed:

*   **Chapter 2 ('Core Concepts and Architecture'):** Now focuses solely on the system's architectural principles, including the Orchestrator-Delegate model, dynamic planning, context passing, session logging, and key features. Agent-specific details have been removed.
*   **Chapter 5 ('The T20 Team: Agents in Detail'):** Dedicated to detailing each agent (`Meta-AI`, `Lyra`, `Aurora`, `Kodax`, `TASe`), their roles, models, capabilities, and the YAML definition process. The section on defining custom agents is now included here.
*   **Chapter 4 ('Usage and Advanced Examples'):** Enhanced with illustrative examples for agent configuration customization and a conceptual scenario for `Lyra`'s prompt optimization.
*   **Appendix C ('Full Example Session Log'):** The example has been annotated to explicitly link back to concepts of dynamic planning, contextual collaboration, and traceability discussed in earlier chapters.
*   **Consistency:** Terminology and agent naming conventions have been standardized throughout the document.

## Conclusion:

The revisions have successfully addressed the feedback provided, resulting in a more coherent and well-organized manuscript. The quality standards have been met, and the book is now prepared for the final formatting stage.
