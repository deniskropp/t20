# Chapter 2: Core Concepts and Features of the T20 System

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles and distinctive characteristics that define the T20 Multi-Agent System. Understanding these core concepts is crucial for appreciating the system's power, flexibility, and unique approach to tackling complex tasks through collaborative AI.

## Core Concepts

The operational workflow of the T20 system is built upon a clear, sequential, and highly adaptable pattern:

1.  **Initialization**: The process begins when a user provides a single, high-level goal via a command-line interface. This goal serves as the directive for the entire agent team. For example: "Design a modern landing page for a new SaaS product."

2.  **Dynamic Planning**: Upon receiving the goal, the `Orchestrator` agent (powered by `Meta-AI`) performs an analysis. It assesses the user's objective in conjunction with the capabilities of the available specialized agents. Subsequently, it queries a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, to generate a structured, step-by-step plan. This plan is typically formatted in JSON and meticulously outlines the sequence of roles and specific tasks required to achieve the overarching goal.

3.  **Task Delegation & Execution**: The `Orchestrator` then systematically progresses through the generated plan. For each step, it assigns the task to the most appropriate specialized agent based on their defined role and expertise (e.g., a design-related task would be delegated to `Aurora`, the Designer).

4.  **Contextual Collaboration**: A critical aspect of T20 is how context is maintained. The output, or artifact, produced by each executed step is saved and made available as input for subsequent steps. This creates a coherent chain of context, enabling agents to build upon the work of their predecessors and ensuring that information is passed effectively throughout the workflow.

5.  **Meta-Learning & Adaptation**: A unique feature of the T20 system is the inclusion of a `Prompt Engineer` agent, known as `Lyra`. `Lyra` can be tasked with refining the system prompts of other agents *during* the execution of a workflow. This capability allows for real-time optimization of agent performance tailored to the specific demands of the current goal.

6.  **Session Logging**: To ensure transparency and facilitate debugging, the entire process—from the initial goal input and the generated plan to every agent's action, prompt, and final output—is meticulously logged within a distinct session directory. This provides a complete, auditable trail of the system's operation.

## Features

The T20 Multi-Agent System is equipped with a robust set of features designed for efficiency, flexibility, and ease of use:

*   **Declarative Agent Definition**: Agents are configured using simple, human-readable YAML files. This makes it straightforward to define, manage, and extend the capabilities of the agent team by outlining their roles, goals, and the models they utilize.

*   **Dynamic, AI-Generated Plans**: Eliminating the need for hardcoded workflows, T20 relies on the Orchestrator to dynamically create custom, step-by-step plans for every unique user goal. This ensures adaptability and tailored solutions.

*   **Role-Based Delegation**: Tasks are intelligently assigned to agents based on their specialized roles and expertise. This ensures that the right agent handles the right task, optimizing efficiency and quality.

*   **Structured LLM Outputs**: The system leverages **Pydantic** for schema enforcement, ensuring that the plans generated by LLMs are reliable, machine-readable, and adhere to a strict structure, which is vital for predictable execution.

*   **Stateful Sessions**: Each execution of the T20 system is isolated within its own session directory. This directory contains all artifacts, prompts, and results, providing a complete and self-contained record of the run for easy review and debugging.

*   **CLI-Driven**: The system is designed for ease of use, operating through a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI). Users can initiate complex tasks by providing a high-level goal as a string argument.

*   **Powered by Google Gemini**: T20 harnesses the power of Google's advanced Gemini models. It utilizes highly capable models like `gemini-2.5-pro` for orchestration and planning, and efficient models such as `gemini-2.5-flash` for specialized agent tasks, offering a balance of power and performance.
