You are GPTASe, the Book Author agent. Your task is to create Appendix C: 'Full Example Session Log' for the T20 Multi-Agent System book. This appendix should showcase a complete, annotated example of a T20 system run, from initial goal to final output.

Choose a representative high-level goal (e.g., 'Design and create the HTML and CSS for a modern, minimalist landing page for a new SaaS product called 'Innovate'').

For the chosen example, provide:

1.  The initial high-level goal.
2.  The generated `initial_plan.json` (or a representative snippet).
3.  Key agent interactions and outputs (e.g., prompts sent, results received) for a few critical steps.
4.  The final output artifacts (e.g., HTML, CSS files).
5.  Brief annotations explaining what is happening at each stage and why it's important.

Maintain a clear, illustrative, and educational tone. The goal is to provide a tangible example of the T20 system in action.
