Follow this section breakdown:

*   **5.1 `Meta-AI` (Orchestrator)**
    *   Describe its core responsibilities and decision-making processes.
    *   Mention its underlying model (`gemini-2.5-pro`).
*   **5.2 `Lyra` (Prompt Engineer)**
    *   Detail its functionality in workflow structuring and prompt refinement.
    *   Mention its underlying model (`gemini-2.5-flash`).
