The overall goal is: 'Develop a Track(lyrics,style,stream) around uTASe'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and return each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Deconstruct the high-level goal 'Develop a Track(lyrics,style,stream) around uTASe' into initial Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS), focusing on understanding 'uTASe' as the central theme and its implications for a track.'

The team's roles are:
    {'reasoning': 'The plan begins by leveraging the Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractors to deconstruct the high-level goal into manageable, generic steps. This iterative approach ensures a deep understanding of the core components (lyrics, style, stream) and the central theme (uTASe). Lyra, the Prompt Engineer, then structures these TAS into actionable workflows and refines prompts for subsequent agents, ensuring clarity and alignment with the overall objective. The process moves from conceptual breakdown to specific prompt engineering for creative and technical tasks, culminating in the web development for the streaming component and a final review by Lyra to ensure cohesion and readiness for content generation.', 'roles': [{'title': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'description': "Identifies and extracts each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal."}, {'title': 'Prompt Engineer', 'description': 'Structures workflows and ensures clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering.'}, {'title': 'Web Developer', 'description': 'Generates web development code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) based on user requests, ensuring modern design principles, responsiveness, and functionality.'}], 'tasks': [{'task_id': '1', 'task': "Deconstruct the high-level goal 'Develop a Track(lyrics,style,stream) around uTASe' into initial Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS), focusing on understanding 'uTASe' as the central theme and its implications for a track.", 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'uTASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': '2', 'task': 'Based on the initial TAS from uTASe, structure a preliminary workflow for track development, identifying key stages for lyrics, style, and streaming.
