The overall goal is: 'Develop a Track(lyrics,style,stream) around uTASe'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Based on the initial TAS from uTASe, structure a preliminary workflow for track development, identifying key stages for lyrics, style, and streaming. Draft initial high-level prompts for subsequent agents.'

The team's roles are:
