  "reviewFeedback": {
    "overallAssessment": "The refactoring changes appear to align well with the design specifications and maintain visual consistency and user experience. The testing results indicate that all defined goals for functionality, performance, and accessibility have been met. However, a few minor points could be considered for further refinement.",
    "colorPalette": {
      "themeSwitch": "Excellent implementation of the theme switch and adherence to WCAG guidelines. Consider adding a small visual indicator alongside the toggle to explicitly communicate the theme name (e.g., 'Default Theme' or 'High Contrast Theme'). This will further enhance the user experience, especially for users with cognitive disabilities.",
      "colorUsage": "The color palette is well-defined and the contrast ratios meet accessibility standards. Ensure the amber color is used sparingly and only with dark gray or black text as specified, especially when new features are added in the future."
    },
    "typography": {
      "fontScaling": "The implementation of browser zoom for font scaling is a good practice. Consider adding a custom font size control within the app for users who may have difficulty using browser zoom or prefer a more granular level of control.",
      "semanticHTML": "Excellent use of semantic HTML. Ensure all new components and sections of the application continue to adhere to semantic HTML practices."
    },
    "taskCreationForm": {
      "progressiveDisclosure": "The progressive disclosure implementation is effective and improves the user experience. Ensure the state of the 'Add Details' button (expanded/collapsed) is visually clear and easily understandable.",
      "errorHandling": "The error handling is well-implemented. Consider adding inline validation to provide immediate feedback as the user types, further enhancing the user experience."
    },
    "feedbackMechanisms": {
      "auditoryCues": "The optional auditory cues are a nice touch. Ensure there is a clear and easily accessible setting to control the volume or disable auditory cues entirely, catering to user preferences.",
      "ariaLiveRegions": "The use of ARIA live regions is correctly implemented. Ensure that the messages announced by screen readers are concise and informative, avoiding unnecessary verbosity."
    },
    "performance": {
      "taskListOptimization": "The memoization techniques have effectively reduced re-renders. Continue to monitor performance as the application evolves and the data set grows. Consider virtualization or pagination if the task list becomes excessively long in the future.",
      "codeMaintainability": "The consistent coding style and thorough documentation significantly improve maintainability. Encourage the team to maintain these practices as the application grows."
    },
    "generalSuggestions": {
      "documentation": "The documentation is comprehensive. Consider adding a design rationale section to explain the reasoning behind key design decisions and accessibility considerations. This will be valuable for future developers and designers.",
      "componentLibrary": "Document and maintain UI components into a component library. This will help keep a consistent look and feel as the application evolves."
    },
    "accessibilityCompliance": "The application demonstrates excellent accessibility compliance. Continue to prioritize accessibility in all future development efforts. Regularly conduct accessibility audits and user testing with people with disabilities to identify and address any potential issues.",
    "nextSteps": "The refactoring process has been successful. The next steps should focus on monitoring user feedback, addressing any minor issues identified during testing, and planning for future enhancements based on user needs and business requirements."
