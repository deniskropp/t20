The overall goal is: 'refactoring'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Review the implemented refactoring changes to ensure they align with the design specifications and maintain visual consistency and user experience. Provide feedback to the Engineer for any necessary adjustments.'

Please use the following outputs from the other agents as your input:
