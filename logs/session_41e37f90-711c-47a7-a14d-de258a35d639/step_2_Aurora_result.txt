The refactoring will address identified usability issues and align the design with current trends and accessibility guidelines.",

        "issueId": "UI-001",
        "description": "Inconsistent use of color contrast across the application, potentially hindering readability for users with visual impairments.",
        "accessibilityConcern": "WCAG 2.0 Level AA requires a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.",
        "proposedSolution": "Implement a new color palette with sufficient contrast ratios, verified using accessibility testing tools. Provide options for users to select alternative high-contrast themes."

        "issueId": "UI-002",
        "description": "The current typography lacks clear hierarchy, making it difficult for users to quickly scan and understand information.",
        "accessibilityConcern": "Poor typography affects readability and can cause cognitive overload, particularly for users with dyslexia or learning disabilities.",
        "proposedSolution": "Refactor typography using a clear hierarchy of font sizes and weights. Use semantic HTML to structure content logically. Ensure sufficient line height and letter spacing for readability."

        "issueId": "UX-003",
        "description": "The task creation flow is cumbersome, requiring too many steps and fields, leading to user frustration.",
        "accessibilityConcern": "Complex forms can be difficult for users with motor impairments or cognitive disabilities to navigate and complete.",
        "proposedSolution": "Simplify the task creation form by reducing the number of required fields and implementing progressive disclosure. Provide clear and concise labels and instructions. Ensure keyboard navigation is intuitive and efficient."
      },

        "issueId": "UX-004",
        "description": "Lack of sufficient feedback on user actions (e.g., task completion, deletion), creating uncertainty and a poor user experience.",
        "accessibilityConcern": "Lack of feedback can be disorienting, especially for users who rely on assistive technologies.",
        "proposedSolution": "Implement clear and immediate feedback for all user actions. Use visual cues, auditory cues (where appropriate and controllable), and ARIA attributes to communicate state changes to assistive technologies."
