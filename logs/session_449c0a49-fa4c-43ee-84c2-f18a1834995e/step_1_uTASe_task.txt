The overall goal is: 'Create a website that is a frontend to an AI system like this.'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and return each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Analyze the project scope to extract a comprehensive list of Task-Agnostic Steps required for creating the AI frontend.'

The team's roles are:
    {'roles': [{'title': 'Designer', 'description': 'Generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.'}, {'title': 'Engineer', 'description': 'Implement designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.'}, {'title': 'Prompt Engineer', 'description': 'Structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering.'}, {'title': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor (flash)', 'description': "Identify and return each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal."}], 'steps': [{'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': "Define the website's core purpose, target audience, and key user interactions with the AI system to establish a clear project scope."}, {'name': 'uTASe', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor (flash)', 'task': 'Analyze the project scope to extract a comprehensive list of Task-Agnostic Steps required for creating the AI frontend.'}, {'name': 'Aurora', 'role': 'Designer', 'task': 'Create low-fidelity wireframes and user flow diagrams based on the defined scope, focusing on intuitive navigation and interaction layout.'}, {'name': 'Aurora', 'role': 'Designer', 'task': 'Develop a high-fidelity design system, including color palettes, typography, and interactive UI mockups for all website components.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': 'Set up the frontend development environment, including the project structure, framework, and necessary build tools.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': 'Translate the high-fidelity mockups into responsive, accessible, and modular UI components using clean code.'}, {'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': 'Design the API contract and prompt structures for frontend-to-AI communication, defining how requests are made and responses are handled.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': "Implement the logic to connect the frontend to the AI system's API, managing application state (e.g., loading, data, errors) effectively."}, {'name': 'Aurora', 'role': 'Designer', 'task': 'Conduct a design review of the implemented frontend to ensure it aligns with the mockups and provides a high-quality user experience.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': 'Perform final testing, including cross-browser compatibility checks, performance optimization, and bug fixing based on team feedback.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': 'Deploy the completed and tested website to a production server, ensuring it is live and accessible to users.'}]}

  "project_scope": {
    "core_purpose": "To serve as an intuitive and accessible web-based interface for users to interact with a sophisticated AI system, enabling them to leverage AI capabilities for various tasks without requiring deep technical knowledge. The website aims to simplify complex AI interactions into a user-friendly experience.",
    "target_audience": "Individuals and professionals seeking to leverage advanced AI capabilities for tasks such as content creation, information retrieval, problem-solving, or creative endeavors. Users are expected to have basic computer literacy but not necessarily technical expertise in AI or programming. They value ease of use, efficiency, and accurate AI responses.",

      {
        "interaction_type": "Input Submission",
        "details": "Users will primarily submit text-based prompts to the AI system. Future considerations may include support for file uploads (e.g., images for analysis, documents for summarization) if the underlying AI system supports such modalities."
      },
      {
        "interaction_type": "AI Response Display",
        "details": "The website will clearly and immediately display AI-generated outputs, which may include text, images, or structured data, depending on the AI's capabilities. Users should have options to copy, download, or share these outputs."
      },
      {
        "interaction_type": "Iterative Interaction & Refinement",
        "details": "Users will be able to engage in conversational or iterative interactions, providing follow-up prompts or modifying previous inputs to refine AI responses. A feedback mechanism (e.g., 'like'/'dislike' buttons) for AI outputs will be included to gather user satisfaction data."
      },
      {
        "interaction_type": "Session Management & History",
        "details": "The system will allow users to view their past interactions and conversation history, and easily start new interactions. User accounts will enable personalized experiences, persistent history, and preference management."
