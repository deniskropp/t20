  "design_review": {
    "overall_assessment": "The implemented frontend components and structure, as detailed in Kodax's outputs (steps_4 and 5), demonstrate a strong alignment with the high-fidelity mockups and design system established by Aurora (step_3). The chosen technology stack and project setup by Kodax (step_4) provide a solid foundation for a performant and maintainable application. The integration plan by Kodax (step_7) effectively maps the API contract from Lyra (step_6) to the frontend logic and state management.",
    "alignment_with_mockups": {
      "status": "High",
      "details": "The core UI components (Input, Button, ResponseCard, FeedbackButton, LoadingIndicator, NavigationLink) have been designed and their implementation outlined to match the visual attributes, states, and accessibility considerations specified in the high-fidelity mockups and design system. The structure of the `HomePage` and `HistoryPage` as described in the integration plan also reflects the layout and content elements from the mockups."
    },
    "user_experience_quality": {
      "status": "Good, with areas for refinement",
      "details": "The design emphasizes clarity, spaciousness, and intuitive interaction, which are key to a high-quality UX. The plan for state management with Zustand and the integration of loading/error states are crucial for perceived performance and user feedback. Areas for refinement include ensuring seamless streaming implementation (if pursued), robust error handling across all API interactions, and potentially adding subtle animations or transitions to enhance the user experience further without compromising performance or accessibility."
    },
    "accessibility_adherence": {
      "status": "Good, with specific implementation notes",
      "details": "The design system explicitly calls out accessibility considerations, and Kodax's component implementations (e.g., `Input` with `aria-describedby`, `LoadingIndicator` with `role='status'`) reflect an understanding of these requirements. The use of semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and focus management (via Tailwind's focus states) are positive indicators. Continued vigilance during development is needed to ensure keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast are maintained across all interactive elements and content."
    },
    "thematic_cohesion": {
      "status": "High",
      "details": "The color palette, typography (Inter font), and the 'clean aesthetic, minimally natural design' principle are consistently applied across the design artifacts. The proposed logo concept and tagline ('AuraFlow AI', 'Intelligent Interaction, Naturally.') also reinforce this theme. The implementation plan for Tailwind CSS in `tailwind.config.ts` is set up to inherit these thematic elements."
    },
    "key_observations_and_recommendations": [
      {
        "observation": "The `Input` component's `resize: 'vertical'` aligns with the prompt's need for potentially longer inputs.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure this resizing behavior is user-friendly and doesn't disrupt the overall layout on smaller screens."
      },
      {
        "observation": "The `FeedbackButton` design includes `isActive` state, which is good for user feedback on selection.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure the visual distinction for the active state is clear and accessible, and that the `submitFeedback` action correctly updates this state."
      },
      {
        "observation": "The API contract specifies `stream: true` as an option for `/generate`.",
        "recommendation": "Prioritize implementing streaming in the `fetchAiResponse` action and updating the `ResponseCard` to handle incremental updates. This significantly enhances the perceived responsiveness and user experience for AI interactions."
      },
      {
        "observation": "Error handling is outlined in Lyra's contract and Kodax's integration plan.",
        "recommendation": "Implement user-facing error messages that are informative and actionable, potentially using a toast notification system or inline error displays within relevant components, as hinted in Kodax's notes."
      },
      {
        "observation": "The `HistoryPage` requires fetching summaries and then full conversations.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure the transition between viewing summaries and loading a full conversation is smooth, with appropriate loading states and clear indication of which conversation is currently loaded."
      },
      {
        "observation": "Accessibility notes are present for most components.",
        "recommendation": "Conduct thorough accessibility testing (e.g., using WAVE, Axe, or browser developer tools) on all interactive elements and content, especially after integration into pages and with dynamic content loading."
      }
    ],
    "overall_ux_evaluation": "The design direction and planned implementation create a promising foundation for an intuitive, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing AI interaction website. The focus on clean design principles and robust state management, combined with adherence to the API contract, sets the stage for a high-quality user experience. The critical next steps involve meticulous implementation, rigorous testing, and iterative refinement, particularly around the streaming functionality and comprehensive accessibility checks."
