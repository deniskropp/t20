    "reasoning": "The user wants to create a prompt for an epic soundtrack for 'Multi-Agent Future', focusing on lyrics and sound. This requires a structured approach, breaking down the high-level goal into actionable steps for different AI agents. The plan will first define the theme and lyrics, then the music production, and finally, it will outline the prompt for these two agents. The 'Prompt Engineer' will structure the overall workflow, the 'Task-Agnostic Step extractor' will identify granular steps, and the 'lyrics' and 'sound' agents will be the primary focus for content generation, with 'stream' being out of scope for this specific prompt creation task.",
