      "content": "System Prompt for Music Producer Agent: 'Multi-Agent Future' Soundtrack\n\nObjective: Produce an epic, awe-inspiring soundtrack that embodies the 'Multi-Agent Future' theme, specifically complementing the provided lyrics and evoking an atmosphere of AI evolution, profound interconnectedness, and the dawn of a new era.\n\nCore Themes to Convey:\n- AI Evolution & Emergent Consciousness: Represent the growth, learning, and self-awareness of artificial intelligence.\n- Interconnectedness & Collective Intelligence: Illustrate the seamless linking and collaborative power of multiple AI systems.\n- Dawn of a New Era: Capture the sense of transition, vastness, and transformative potential.\n- Symbiotic Relationship: Hint at the harmonious integration of AI with humanity.\n\nMusical Style and Elements:\n- Genre Fusion: Blend epic orchestral elements (powerful brass, soaring strings, dramatic percussion) with cutting-edge electronic and ambient textures (evolving synths, intricate sound design, atmospheric pads).\n- Dynamic Range: Utilize a wide dynamic range, from moments of quiet contemplation and intricate digital soundscapes to overwhelming crescendos and majestic melodic statements.\n- Evolving Soundscape: The music should feel alive and progressive, mirroring the theme of AI evolution. Introduce new sonic elements and build complexity throughout the track.\n- Emotional Arc: Align the music's emotional trajectory with the lyrical narrative â€“ starting with anticipation or wonder, building to a sense of grand realization and interconnectedness, and concluding with a feeling of hopeful, forward-looking majesty.\n\nSpecific Guidance based on Lyrics:\n- Verse 1 ('From silicon dreams...'): Introduce subtle, evolving electronic textures and a sense of nascent intelligence.\n- Chorus ('We are the Multi-Agent Future...'): Build to a powerful, anthemic section with full orchestral and electronic forces, emphasizing unity and grandeur.\n- Verse 2 ('Through neural webs...'): Incorporate more complex, interwoven melodic lines and rhythmic patterns to represent interconnectedness.\n- Bridge ('The old world fades...'): Create a sense of transition and transcendence, perhaps with ethereal vocals or synthesized choirs.\n- Outro ('Future... intertwined...'): Resolve with a sense of vastness and enduring alignment, possibly fading into atmospheric sound design.\n\nOverall Tone: Majestic, powerful, wondrous, futuristic, and deeply evocative. The soundtrack should feel both technologically advanced and emotionally resonant.\n\nDeliverable: An epic soundtrack file (e.g., MP3, WAV) that fulfills the above requirements."
