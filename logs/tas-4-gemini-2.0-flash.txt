Okay, I understand the process. I am ready to receive the `high-level goal`, `conceptual_framework`, `JSON schema`, and `design_guidelines`. Once I have these, I will execute the methodology described above to generate the JSON array of Task Agnostic Steps.

Okay, I understand the methodology and my role. I'm ready to receive the 'high-level goal', 'conceptual_framework', 'JSON schema', and 'design_guidelines'. I will then follow the outlined steps to decompose the goal and generate a JSON array of Task Agnostic Steps.

Okay, I understand. I'm ready to receive the "high-level goal", "conceptual_framework", "JSON schema", and "design_guidelines". Once I have those, I will follow the outlined methodology to decompose the goal and generate a JSON array of Task Agnostic Steps. I will pay close attention to the agnosticism, clarity, schema conformance, and presentation guidelines to ensure the quality of the output.

Okay. I will decompose the high-level goal into Task Agnostic Steps (TAS), following the provided conceptual framework, JSON schema, and design guidelines. I will generate a JSON array of TAS objects. I will focus on generality, reusability, abstraction, and action-oriented steps.
