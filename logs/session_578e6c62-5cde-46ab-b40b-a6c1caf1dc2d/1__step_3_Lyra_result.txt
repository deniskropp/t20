  "output": "The consolidated Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) for 'Dimas Realm' have been structured into a coherent workflow. This workflow serves as the foundation for generating specific system prompts for the Designer (Aurora). The workflow prioritizes a logical progression from project initiation and planning through execution, monitoring, and closure, ensuring all critical aspects are considered.\n\n**Consolidated Workflow for 'Dimas Realm':**\n\n1.  **Initiation & Definition:**\n    *   Define Project Scope (TAS ID: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef)\n    *   Identify Key Stakeholders (TAS ID: b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-2345-67890abcdef1)\n\n2.  **Planning & Strategy:**\n    *   Establish Success Metrics (TAS ID: c3d4e5f6-a7b8-9012-3456-7890abcdef12)\n    *   Map Dependencies (TAS ID: d4e5f6a7-b8c9-0123-4567-890abcdef123)\n    *   Outline Project Phases (TAS ID: e5f6a7b8-c9d0-1234-5678-90abcdef1234)\n    *   Allocate Resources (TAS ID: f6a7b8c9-d0e1-2345-6789-0abcdef12345)\n    *   Develop Execution Strategy (TAS ID: a7b8c9d0-e1f2-3456-7890-abcdef123456)\n\n3.  **Execution:**\n    *   Implement Project Plan (TAS ID: b8c9d0e1-f2a3-4567-890a-bcdef1234567)\n\n4.  **Monitoring & Control:**\n    *   Monitor Progress and Performance (TAS ID: c9d0e1f2-a3b4-5678-90ab-cdef12345678)\n    *   Manage Project Changes (TAS ID: e1f2a3b4-c5d6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890)\n\n5.  **Review & Closure:**\n    *   Review and Validate Deliverables (TAS ID: d0e1f2a3-b4c5-6789-0abc-def123456789)\n    *   Document Project Outcomes (TAS ID: f2a3b4c5-d6e7-8901-bcde-f12345678901)\n\n**System Prompts for Designer (Aurora):**\n\nBased on the consolidated workflow and the overall goal 'Dimas Realm', here are the system prompts tailored for Aurora:\n\n*   **Prompt 1 (Project Vision & Scope Definition):** \"As the Designer for 'Dimas Realm', your primary task is to translate the project's defined scope and objectives into a compelling visual identity and user experience. Focus on establishing a clear and inspiring visual direction that aligns with the project's core purpose. Consider the key stakeholders identified and ensure the design reflects their needs and expectations. Your initial output should include mood boards, a preliminary color palette, and typography selections that set the tone for 'Dimas Realm'.\"\n\n*   **Prompt 2 (UI/UX Flow and Layout Design):** \"Building upon the established visual identity, design the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) flows for 'Dimas Realm'. Ensure the design is intuitive, accessible, and visually balanced, adhering to best practices in user-centered design. Map out the key screens and interactions, paying close attention to the dependencies and phases outlined in the project plan. Prioritize creating a seamless and engaging user journey that supports the project's success metrics. Document these flows and layouts clearly for the engineering team.\"\n\n*   **Prompt 3 (Iterative Design & Refinement):** \"Throughout the 'Dimas Realm' project, you will be responsible for iterating on designs based on feedback from progress monitoring and change management processes. Your role is to adapt and refine the visual elements and user flows to accommodate necessary adjustments, always ensuring that the core vision and user experience remain strong and aligned with the project's evolving requirements. Maintain design consistency and document all changes to the design specifications.\"",
