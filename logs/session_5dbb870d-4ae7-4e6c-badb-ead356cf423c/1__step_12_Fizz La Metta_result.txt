As the Coordinator, I have overseen the execution of each phase, from initial Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extraction to the final validation of the integrated tool.\n\n## Task Execution Summary\n\n*   **T1, T2, T3 (TAS Extraction):** Multiple agents (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe) successfully identified and extracted Task-Agnostic Steps.\n*   **T4 (Consolidation):** Lyra (Prompt Engineer) consolidated these steps into a coherent list (`consolidated_task_agnostic_steps.json`).\n*   **T5 (Prompt Engineering):** Lyra engineered system prompts for each agent (`agent_system_prompts.json`), ensuring clear instructions and role alignment.\n*   **T6 (Architecture):** Kodax (Engineer) defined the tool's architecture and data flow (`architecture_data_flow.md`).\n*   **T7 (Design):** Aurora (Designer) provided UI/UX specifications (`aurora_design_spec.json`).\n*   **T8 (Front-end Dev):** Qwen3-WebDev (Web Developer) developed front-end components (`SourceSelectionForm.jsx`, `IntegrationMappingInterface.jsx`, `ResultsDisplay.jsx`, `Dashboard.jsx`, `Dashboard.css`).\n*   **T9 (Core Logic):** Kodax implemented the core weaving logic (`weaveToolLogic.js`), integrating with front-end components.\n*   **T10 (SYS Integration):** Kodax ensured the SYS source integration within the core logic.\n*   **T11 (TEMPLATE Integration):** Kodax ensured the TEMPLATE source integration within the core logic.\n*   **T12 (Validation):** Kodax conducted and reported on the validation of the integrated tool (`test_report_T12.md`).\n\n## Final Deliverables\n\nThe primary deliverables include:\n\n*   `consolidated_task_agnostic_steps.json`: The refined list of steps for the project.\n*   `agent_system_prompts.json`: System prompts guiding each agent.\n*   `architecture_data_flow.md`: The defined architecture and data flow.\n*   `aurora_design_spec.json`: UI/UX design specifications.\n*   Front-end component files (React JSX, CSS).\n*   `weaveToolLogic.js`: The core logic for weaving the tool.\n*   `test_report_T12.md`: The validation report confirming successful integration.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll tasks have been executed successfully, and the integrated tool, as represented by the generated code and documentation, meets the project's objective of weaving functionality from both SYS and TEMPLATE sources. The team has effectively collaborated to deliver a cohesive solution.\n\n**Coordinator:** Fizz La Metta"
