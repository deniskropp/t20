## Project: System Overview Generation

This repository details the collaborative process undertaken to generate a comprehensive system overview. This overview includes both a visual representation of the system architecture and a functional interactive prototype. The project was a joint effort between a Prompt Engineer (Lyra), a Designer (Aurora), and an Engineer (Kodax).

### Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project were:

1.  **Visual System Overview:** To create a clear, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing visual representation of a system's architecture, components, and data flow.
2.  **Functional Prototype:** To develop an interactive prototype that demonstrates the key functionalities and data interactions of the system.
3.  **Collaborative Workflow:** To establish and execute an effective collaborative workflow between design and engineering roles, facilitated by precise and iterative prompting.

### Project Structure and Roles

The project followed a structured, step-by-step approach, with distinct roles contributing to the final output:

*   **Prompt Engineer (Lyra):** Responsible for defining the overall project workflow, creating detailed prompts for other agents, refining these prompts based on feedback, and ensuring clarity and coherence in instructions.
*   **Designer (Aurora):** Tasked with creating the visual aspects of the system overview, including layout, color palettes, typography, component design, and UI flows, with a strong emphasis on accessibility and visual balance.
*   **Engineer (Kodax):** Responsible for translating the system architecture into a functional prototype, implementing responsive design, ensuring accessibility, and providing detailed textual descriptions of the implementation.

### Workflow and Artifacts

The project progressed through several key stages, generating specific artifacts at each step:

1.  **Initial Planning & Task Decomposition (Lyra):**
    *   `initial_plan.json`: Document outlining the project's high-level steps and assigned roles.
    *   `step_0_Lyra_result.txt`: A detailed breakdown of the overall project goal into actionable tasks for the Designer and Engineer.

2.  **Designer Prompt Creation (Lyra):**
    *   `step_1_Lyra_result.txt`: The initial prompt for the Designer, focusing on creating a visually clear and aesthetically pleasing system overview.

3.  **System Overview Design (Aurora):**
    *   `step_2_Aurora_result.txt`: Document containing Aurora's design process, including specifications for the system overview diagram (type, color palette, typography, components, UI flow), a visual description, and a prompt for generating an image of the design.

4.  **Designer Prompt Refinement (Lyra):**
    *   `step_3_Lyra_result.txt`: A refined prompt for the Designer, incorporating specific requirements for accessibility and justification for design choices.

5.  **Engineer Prompt Creation (Lyra):**
    *   `step_4_Lyra_result.txt`: The prompt provided to the Engineer, outlining the requirements for creating an interactive prototype with a focus on key functionalities and data interactions.

6.  **System Prototype Implementation (Kodax):**
    *   `step_5_Kodax_result.txt`: This artifact contains Kodax's implementation plan, the actual code for the prototype (`index.html`, `style.css`), notes on accessibility considerations, a description of the implemented prototype, and suggestions for future development.

7.  **Engineer Prototype Evaluation & Prompt Refinement (Lyra):**
    *   `step_6_Lyra_task.txt`: The task assigned to Lyra for evaluating the Engineer's prototype and refining subsequent prompts for further improvements.

### Key Outputs

The culmination of this project resulted in:

*   **A Visual System Architecture:** A well-defined and visually appealing diagram that clearly illustrates the system's structure, components, and data flow.
*   **An Interactive Prototype:** A functional web-based prototype demonstrating core system features and user interactions, built with a focus on responsiveness and accessibility.

This project showcases a structured, iterative, and collaborative approach to developing complex system overviews, balancing design aesthetics with functional implementation.
