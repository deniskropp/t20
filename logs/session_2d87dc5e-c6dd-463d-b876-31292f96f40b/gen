```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`create_jsonl_dataset(data, output_filename="finetuning_dataset.jsonl")` Function:**
    *   This function takes the `data` (a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is a prompt-completion pair) and an `output_filename` as input.
    *   It opens the specified file in write mode (`'w'`) with UTF-8 encoding to ensure broad compatibility.
    *   It iterates through each `entry` (data point) in the provided `data`.
    *   For each entry, it performs a basic check to ensure it has both a `prompt` and a `completion` key, as defined by Lyra's schema.
    *   It converts the dictionary into a JSON string using `json.dumps()`.
    *   It writes the JSON string to the file, followed by a newline character (`'\n'`). This adheres to the JSON Lines (JSONL) format.
    *   Includes print statements for user feedback on the process and any potential errors.

2.  **`deploy_script()` Function:**
    *   This function simulates the deployment aspect of the task. In a real-world scenario, this would involve making the script available for execution, perhaps by:
        *   Committing it to a version control system (like Git).
        *   Integrating it into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to run automatically after data validation.
        *   Scheduling it as a cron job if the process is to be run periodically.
        *   Making it an executable script in a deployment environment.
    *   For this simulation, it simply prints confirmation messages indicating that the script is "deployed" and ready to be used.

3.  **`if __name__ == "__main__":` Block:**
    *   This block ensures that the code inside it only runs when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module).
    *   **Input Data Simulation:** It directly uses the `validated_data_from_lyra` variable, which is populated with the example data provided in `1__step_6_Lyra_result.txt`. This simulates having the final, structured, and validated data ready for packaging.
    *   **Execution of the Sub-task:** It calls `create_jsonl_dataset()` with the simulated data to generate the `finetuning_dataset.jsonl` file.
    *   **Deployment Simulation:** It calls `deploy_script()` to confirm the script's readiness for deployment.
    *   Finally, it prints a summary message indicating the completion of the task.

This script directly addresses the sub-task of writing and deploying scripts to automate the final packaging of validated datasets into a machine-readable format (JSONL) suitable for fine-tuning, using the outputs from previous steps. It focuses on modularity (separate functions for packaging and deployment) and clarity by providing print statements for user feedback.
