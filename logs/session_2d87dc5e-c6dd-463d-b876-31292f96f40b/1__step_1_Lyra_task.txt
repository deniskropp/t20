The overall goal is: 'Create a dataset for LLM fine-tuning towards internalized TAS expertise'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Establish criteria for sourcing raw data and create a plan for gathering diverse examples of high-level goals and project descriptions.'

The team's roles are:
    {'roles': [{'title': 'Designer', 'description': 'Designs the user interface and experience for the data annotation and review tool, ensuring it is intuitive, efficient, and accessible.'}, {'title': 'Engineer', 'description': 'Builds and maintains the data collection, annotation, and processing pipeline, including the user-facing tool and data packaging scripts.'}, {'title': 'Prompt Engineer', 'description': 'Defines the dataset schema, structures the data generation workflow, engineers prompts for TAS extraction, and oversees the quality control process.'}, {'title': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'description': 'Processes raw input data (e.g., high-level goals, project plans) to identify and extract Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS).'}], 'steps': [{'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': 'Define the schema and format for the fine-tuning dataset, specifying the structure of input (e.g., high-level goal) and output (e.g., extracted TAS).'}, {'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': 'Establish criteria for sourcing raw data and create a plan for gathering diverse examples of high-level goals and project descriptions.'}, {'name': 'Aurora', 'role': 'Designer', 'task': 'Design a user-friendly interface for annotating, reviewing, and validating the extracted TAS data to ensure dataset quality.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': "Implement the front-end and back-end for the data annotation and review tool based on Aurora's design."}, {'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': 'Develop and refine the system prompts for uTASe to maximize the accuracy and relevance of the extracted TAS.'}, {'name': 'uTASe', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'task': 'Execute the primary extraction process by analyzing the sourced raw data to identify and list all Task-Agnostic Steps.'}, {'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': 'Structure the raw output from uTASe into the predefined dataset schema, creating clean prompt-completion pairs for the LLM.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': 'Write and deploy scripts to automate the final packaging of the validated dataset into a machine-readable format (e.g., JSONL) suitable for fine-tuning.'}]}

Please use the following outputs from the other agents as your input:
