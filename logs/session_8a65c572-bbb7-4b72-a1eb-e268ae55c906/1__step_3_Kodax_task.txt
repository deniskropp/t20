The overall goal is: 'To implement the Humor Evaluator system with all LLM calls routed through the https://ai.violass.club/v1 API, Iâ€™ll modify the previous implementation to integrate API-based language model interactions for generating jokes, analyzing feedback, and making recommendations'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Implement designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Integrate the new API client by refactoring the existing joke generation, feedback analysis, and recommendation features, replacing all previous LLM calls with calls to the new module.'
