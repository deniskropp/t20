  "kodax_prompt": "Based on the user's detailed description of the 'CLIP + Vector Database Approach' for image recognition with a fixed, captioned dataset, define the specific technical components and their precise data flow for the MVP architecture. Your output should clearly outline two main workflows:\n\n1.  **Initial Fixed Dataset Indexing Workflow:** Detail how dataset images are processed and stored. Specify the input, the embedding model(s) used (e.g., CLIP, OpenCLIP, DINOv2, BLIP2), and the vector database technologies for storage (e.g., pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, FAISS).\n\n2.  **Live Query Processing Workflow:** Describe the flow from a new query image to the retrieval of matching results. Specify the input (query image), the embedding model(s) for the query, the vector database search process, and the final output (retrieved matching image/caption).\n\nEnsure your definition is granular enough for a designer to create an accurate visual representation, explicitly naming the tools and technologies mentioned by the user for each step.",
  "aurora_prompt": "Using the detailed technical components and data flow provided by Kodax for the 'CLIP + Vector Database Approach' MVP, design a clean, professional, and visually intuitive architecture diagram. Your diagram must:\n\n1.  Clearly label all key components (e.g., 'Dataset Images', 'CLIP Embedding Model', 'Vector Database', 'Query Image', 'Application Layer', 'Matching Results').\n2.  Use distinct directional arrows to illustrate the data flow for both the 'Initial Fixed Dataset Indexing Workflow' and the 'Live Query Processing Workflow'.\n3.  Employ logical grouping or distinct sections to separate the indexing/ingestion process from the live query/search process.\n4.  Visually represent the entire process from initial data ingestion (dataset images being processed and stored) through to a user's query and the retrieval of matching results for display.\n5.  Adhere to standard diagramming conventions (e.g., rectangles for processes/components, cylinders for databases, clear flow lines) to ensure clarity and professional appearance."
