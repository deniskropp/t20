The overall goal is: 'We are meta-artificial intelligence, cohesively creating an iterative role and task plan, thinking step-by-step towards the high-level goal.

High-Level Goal: 'To implement the Humor Evaluator system with all LLM calls routed through the https://ai.violass.club/v1 API, Iâ€™ll modify the previous implementation to integrate API-based language model interactions for generating jokes, analyzing feedback, and making recommendations'

Team Members:
- Name: 'Aurora'
  Role: `Designer`
  Goal: "Generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance."
- Name: 'Kodax'
  Role: `Engineer`
  Goal: "Implement designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility."
- Name: 'Lyra'
  Role: `Prompt Engineer`
  Goal: "Structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering"
- Name: 'uTASe'
  Role: `Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor (flash)`
  Goal: "Identify and return each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal."

Leverage each team member, guided by their goals, to maximize collaboration. Use prompt engineering to refine the system prompts for each agent based on their roles and tasks.'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and return each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Deconstruct the high-level goal into a sequence of actionable tasks for implementing the Humor Evaluator system with the specified API.'

The team's roles are:
    {'roles': [{'title': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor (flash)', 'description': 'Deconstruct the high-level goal of creating the API-driven Humor Evaluator into a clear, sequential, and actionable task plan for the team.'}, {'title': 'Engineer', 'description': "Implement the full-stack application, focusing on creating a robust API client for https://ai.violass.club/v1, building the user interface based on the designer's specifications, and integrating the prompt-driven logic."}, {'title': 'Prompt Engineer', 'description': 'Develop, test, and refine all LLM prompts for joke generation, feedback analysis, and personalized recommendations, ensuring they are optimized for the https://ai.violass.club/v1 API.'}, {'title': 'Designer', 'description': 'Generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows for the Humor Evaluator, ensuring an intuitive and accessible user experience for joke interaction and feedback.'}], 'steps': [{'name': 'uTASe', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor (flash)', 'task': 'Deconstruct the high-level goal into a sequence of actionable tasks for implementing the Humor Evaluator system with the specified API.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': 'Investigate the `https://ai.violass.club/v1` API documentation to determine authentication methods, request/response formats, and any rate limits.

This includes screens for displaying jokes, collecting user ratings/feedback, and showing personalized recommendations.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': 'Develop a modular and reusable API client in the chosen programming language to handle all communications with the `https://ai.violass.club/v1` endpoint.'}, {'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': 'Finalize and test the core set of prompts for generating jokes, analyzing user feedback, and making recommendations. Use a testing tool to validate prompt effectiveness directly with the API.'}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': "Implement the front-end UI based on the Designer's specifications, creating components for joke display, feedback input, and recommendation lists."}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': "Integrate the API client and the finalized prompts into the application's backend logic. Connect the front-end UI to trigger the appropriate API calls and display the results."}, {'name': 'Lyra', 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'task': "Conduct an end-to-end review of the integrated system, analyzing the quality of the LLM's outputs and iteratively refining the prompts to improve performance and user satisfaction."}, {'name': 'Kodax', 'role': 'Engineer', 'task': 'Perform final integration testing, bug fixing, and prepare the complete Humor Evaluator application for deployment.'}]}

Please execute your sub-task, keeping the overall goal and your role's specific goal in mind to ensure your output is relevant to the project.
