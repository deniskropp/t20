    "visual_consistency": {
      "assessment": "The implemented dashboard components (Dashboard Overview, Task Management) show good adherence to the brand kit's color palette, typography, and overall minimalist aesthetic. Specifically, the use of primary blue (#4A90E2) in headers and accents, the Inter and Roboto fonts, and the clean layout are well-represented in Kodax's provided HTML and CSS.",
      "specific_observations": [
        "Color Palette: Consistent application of primary, secondary, and neutral colors across sections and interactive elements. Status badges and indicators correctly use accent colors for status representation (e.g., 'in_progress', 'blocked').",
        "Typography: 'Inter' font is used for headings and titles, and 'Roboto' for body text and labels, matching the brand kit's specification.",
        "Iconography: While no specific icons were implemented in the provided snippets beyond status indicators, the placeholder for the hierarchy visualization implies the need for lineal icons.",
        "Layout: The structure of the Dashboard Overview and Task Management views (header, content area, controls) aligns with the wireframes and mockups provided in Aurora's initial design."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Ensure the hierarchy visualization placeholder is replaced with a component that uses lineal icons consistent with the brand kit's specified style.",
        "Verify that interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) maintain consistent padding, margins, and hover states across all views.",
        "Confirm that modal focus management is robust to maintain visual and interactive consistency when modals are open."
      ]
    },
    "usability": {
      "assessment": "The implemented UI offers a logical flow and intuitive navigation. Key information is presented upfront on the dashboard, and task management provides essential filtering, sorting, and detailed views. The modal for task details is a standard and effective pattern.",
      "specific_observations": [
        "Navigation: Clear header navigation allows users to move between main sections.",
        "Task Management: Filtering and search functionality are present and appear functional. The table view is standard and easy to scan. The modal for task details provides comprehensive information.",
        "Feedback Mechanisms: Buttons for 'Provide Feedback' and 'Edit Task' are present in the task detail modal, indicating a pathway for user interaction and workflow continuation.",
        "Accessibility Features: Basic accessibility measures like ARIA attributes and focus management are noted, which is a good starting point."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Enhance sorting functionality: Implement the sorting logic for table headers to provide a complete user experience.",
        "Improve modal accessibility: Ensure proper focus trapping within the modal and that focus returns correctly to the triggering element upon closing.",
        "Add visual feedback for interactive states: Ensure all buttons and interactive elements have clear hover and active states.",
        "Refine the 'Add New Task' functionality: Provide a clear user interface or modal for adding new tasks, rather than just an alert.",
        "Consider implementing keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., closing modals, navigating tasks) to further enhance usability.",
        "Ensure the 'Recent Activity' feed is visually distinct and easily scannable, perhaps with subtle color coding for different event types."
      ]
    },
    "adherence_to_design_specifications": {
      "assessment": "The implementation closely follows the design specifications provided by Aurora, particularly in the structure and branding of the dashboard and task management views. The dynamic prompt templates from Lyra are also well-integrated into the envisioned backend logic.",
      "specific_observations": [
        "Brand Kit: Colors, typography, and overall aesthetic are well-represented.",
        "UI Flows: The Dashboard Overview and Task Management flows match the described components and structure.",
        "Wireframes/Mockups: The HTML structure and CSS styles directly translate the visual layout and components outlined in the wireframes and mockups.",
        "Dynamic Prompts: Lyra's dynamic prompt templates are designed to be integrated into the `TASK_ASSIGNMENT` and `FEEDBACK` message payloads, which aligns with Kodax's proposed backend structure."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Confirmation of Dynamic Prompt Integration: While the design specifies how dynamic prompts should be used, the actual implementation details within the backend (Orchestration Service) need to be confirmed to ensure prompts are correctly populated and sent.",
        "Error Handling UI: Define and implement specific UI elements or modals for displaying errors reported by agents (e.g., from `ERROR_REPORT` messages) to ensure users are informed of system issues.",
        "Consistency in Naming: Ensure all UI elements and labels consistently use the terminology established in the brand kit and UI flows (e.g., 'NexusFlow' logo, specific status badge names)."
      ]
    },
    "overall_summary": "The current implementation provides a strong foundation that aligns well with the initial design specifications. Key areas for refinement focus on enhancing the completeness of interactive features (like sorting), improving accessibility details within modals, and ensuring the seamless integration of dynamic prompt generation into the backend workflow. Addressing these points will further solidify the usability and visual consistency of the orchestration dashboard."
