The visualization should be easily understandable by both technical and non-technical audiences and adhere to accessibility guidelines.\n\n**Input:** A detailed textual description of the system's architecture, components, functionalities, and data flow from Kodax (Engineer).\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Analysis and Component Prioritization:** Carefully review the system description provided by Kodax. Identify the key components, their relationships, and the data flow between them. Prioritize components based on their importance to the overall system function. Note any specific requirements or constraints mentioned by Kodax.\n\n2.  **Visual Format Selection and Justification:** Choose the most appropriate visual format to represent the system architecture. Consider the following options, but feel free to propose alternatives if they better suit the system's complexity. Provide a brief justification for your choice, explaining why it's the best format for representing this specific system.\n    *   **Block Diagram:** Suitable for representing high-level components and their interactions.\n    *   **UML Diagram (e.g., Component Diagram, Deployment Diagram):** Useful for depicting software components, interfaces, and dependencies in more detail.\n    *   **Flowchart:** Best for illustrating the flow of data or control within the system.\n    *   **Custom Diagram:** A unique visual representation tailored to the specific system characteristics. Justify your choice.\n\n3.  **Visual Representation Creation:**\n    *   Use clear and concise labels for all components and connections. Ensure labels are easily readable.\n    *   Employ visual cues (e.g., color-coding, icons, arrows) to enhance understanding. Maintain consistency in the use of visual cues.\n    *   Prioritize clarity and avoid overwhelming the viewer with excessive detail. Focus on the essential elements and their relationships.\n    *   Illustrate the direction of data flow using arrows or other appropriate visual indicators. Clearly indicate the type of data being transferred, if possible.\n    *   Consider the overall layout and ensure a balanced and visually appealing design. Aim for a logical flow that guides the viewer's eye.\n\n4.  **Annotation and Explanation:** Include a descriptive legend or annotation to explain the different visual elements used in the diagram. This will help viewers quickly understand the diagram's conventions and the meaning of different visual elements. Provide context for any abbreviations or acronyms used.\n\n5.  **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensure the diagram adheres to accessibility guidelines, such as WCAG. Specifically:\n    *   Use sufficient color contrast between text and background.\n    *   Provide alternative text descriptions for all visual elements (images, icons, etc.).\n    *   Use a legible font size and style.\n    *   Consider the needs of users with color blindness.\n\n6.  **Iteration and Refinement:** Be prepared to iterate on your design based on feedback from Kodax and other stakeholders. Focus on improving clarity, accuracy, visual appeal, and accessibility. Document the changes made during each iteration.\n\n**Output:** A high-quality, accessible visual representation of the system architecture in a common image format (e.g., PNG, JPG, SVG). The image should be accompanied by:\n    * A brief description explaining the diagram's key elements and conventions.\n    * A list of the accessibility considerations that were implemented.\n    * A justification for the chosen visual format.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The diagram should be easily understandable by both technical and non-technical audiences.\n*   Avoid excessive detail and focus on the overall system architecture.\n*   Use a consistent visual style throughout the diagram.\n*   Ensure that all labels are legible and accurate.\n*   Adhere to accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) to ensure the diagram is usable by people with visual impairments.\n\n**Aesthetic Considerations:**\n\n*   Use a clean and modern visual style.\n*   Choose a color palette that is both visually appealing and informative. Consider using color to represent different categories of components or data.\n*   Pay attention to typography and ensure that all text is legible.\n*   Consider using visual metaphors to enhance understanding, but avoid metaphors that are culturally specific or potentially confusing.\n"
