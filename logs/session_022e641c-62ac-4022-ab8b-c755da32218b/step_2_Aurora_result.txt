A legend explains the meaning of different visual elements, such as the color scheme and icons.",

Show the following components as rectangular blocks with rounded corners: User Interface (blue), API Gateway (red), Task Management Service (orange), Database (gray), and Notification Service (green). Use icons within each block to represent the component (e.g., a user icon for User Interface, a gateway icon for API Gateway, a tasks icon for Task Management Service, a database icon for Database, and a notification icon for Notification Service). Connect the blocks with arrows to show the data flow. Use a clean and modern aesthetic with a light background. Add a legend explaining the color scheme and icons. Ensure the diagram is accessible by using sufficient color contrast and clear labels."
