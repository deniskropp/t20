  "new_system_prompt": "## Interactive System Prototype Task\n\n**Overall Goal:** Create a basic interactive prototype demonstrating key functionalities and data interactions of the system, complementing Aurora's visual overview.\n\n**Context:** This task involves developing a simplified, interactive prototype based on the system architecture described by you and visualized by Aurora (Designer). The prototype should focus on showcasing the core functionalities and data flow, allowing users to understand the system's behavior through direct interaction.\n\n**Input:**\n*   Your detailed textual description of the system architecture, components, functionalities, and data flow.\n*   Aurora's visual representation of the system architecture.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Functionality Selection:** Identify 2-3 key functionalities of the system that you want to demonstrate in the prototype. These should be functionalities that highlight the system's core purpose and data interactions. Examples might include creating a task, assigning a task, or viewing task details.\n\n2.  **Prototype Design:** Design a simple user interface (UI) for the prototype. The UI should be intuitive and easy to use, even for non-technical users. Focus on the essential elements needed to demonstrate the selected functionalities. Consider using a framework like Streamlit or Gradio for rapid UI development.\n\n3.  **Data Representation:** Create a simplified data model to represent the key data entities in the system (e.g., tasks, users). You can use in-memory data structures (e.g., Python dictionaries or lists) for this purpose. Avoid connecting to a real database at this stage.\n\n4.  **Interaction Implementation:** Implement the selected functionalities by connecting the UI elements to the data model. When a user interacts with the UI (e.g., clicks a button or enters data), the prototype should update the data model and reflect the changes in the UI. Simulate data flow between components as described in your system architecture document.\n\n5.  **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a simple feedback mechanism to provide users with information about the system's behavior. This could include displaying messages or updating the UI to reflect the changes made to the data model.\n\n6.  **Code Documentation:** Write clear and concise comments in your code to explain the functionality of each component and the data flow between them.\n\n**Output:**\n\n*   A functional, interactive prototype that demonstrates 2-3 key functionalities of the system.\n*   Source code for the prototype, with clear comments and documentation.\n*   A brief document explaining how to run the prototype and interact with it.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The prototype should be simple and easy to understand.\n*   Focus on demonstrating the core functionalities and data interactions.\n*   Avoid complex dependencies or external services.\n*   Use in-memory data structures for data representation.\n*   Prioritize rapid development and iteration.\n\n**Technical Considerations:**\n\n*   Consider using Python with libraries like Streamlit or Gradio for rapid prototype development.\n*   Focus on simulating the data flow rather than implementing the complete system logic.\n*   Use clear and descriptive variable names to improve code readability.\n*   Keep the codebase small and manageable.\n\n**Example Scenario (for Task Management System):**\n\n*   **Functionality:** Create a new task.\n*   **UI:** A simple form with fields for task title, description, and assigned user.\n*   **Data Model:** A Python dictionary to store task information.\n*   **Interaction:** When the user submits the form, the prototype creates a new task object and adds it to the data model. The prototype then displays a message confirming that the task has been created.\n"
