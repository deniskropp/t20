## Project: System Overview

This repository outlines the process of generating a comprehensive system overview, encompassing both a visual representation and a functional prototype.

### Project Goals

*   **System Overview:** To provide a clear, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing representation of a system's architecture, components, and data flow.
*   **Collaboration:** To foster effective collaboration between a designer (Aurora) and an engineer (Kodax) through well-defined prompts and iterative feedback.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into sequential steps, with each step building upon the previous one. The primary roles involved are:

*   **Prompt Engineer (Lyra):** Responsible for defining the workflow, creating and refining prompts for other agents, and ensuring clarity and coherence in instructions.
*   **Designer (Aurora):** Responsible for creating the visual representation of the system architecture, including layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, with a focus on accessibility and visual balance.
*   **Engineer (Kodax):** Responsible for providing detailed textual descriptions of the system architecture and implementing a functional prototype of the system overview, ensuring responsive design and accessibility.

### Workflow & Artifacts

The project follows a structured workflow, with key artifacts generated at each stage:

1.  **Initial Planning & Task Decomposition (Lyra):**
    *   **Artifact:** `initial_plan.json` - Outlines the overall project steps and roles.
    *   **Artifact:** `step_0_Lyra_result.txt` - Decomposes the high-level goal into actionable tasks for the Designer and Engineer.

2.  **Designer Prompt Creation (Lyra):**
    *   **Artifact:** `step_1_Lyra_result.txt` - A detailed prompt for the Designer, focusing on creating a visual system overview with clarity and aesthetics.

3.  **System Overview Design (Aurora):**
    *   **Artifact:** `step_2_Aurora_result.txt` - Contains the design process, system overview design specifications (diagram type, color palette, typography, components, UI flow), visual description, and image prompt.

4.  **Designer Prompt Refinement (Lyra):**
    *   **Artifact:** `step_3_Lyra_result.txt` - Refined prompt for the Designer, incorporating a focus on accessibility and justification for design choices.

5.  **Engineer Prompt Creation (Lyra):**
    *   **Artifact:** `step_4_Lyra_result.txt` - A prompt for the Engineer to create an interactive prototype, focusing on key functionalities and data interactions.

6.  **System Prototype Implementation (Kodax):**
    *   **Artifact:** `step_5_Kodax_result.txt` - Includes the implementation plan, code for the prototype (`index.html`, `style.css`), accessibility notes, prototype description, and suggested next steps.

7.  **Engineer Prototype Evaluation & Prompt Refinement (Lyra):**
    *   **Artifact:** `step_6_Lyra_task.txt` - The task for Lyra to evaluate Kodax's prototype and refine prompts for further improvements.

### Key Outputs

*   **System Visualization:** A clear and aesthetically pleasing diagram representing the system architecture.
*   **Interactive Prototype:** A functional prototype that demonstrates key system functionalities and data interactions.

This project emphasizes a collaborative and iterative approach to building a comprehensive system overview, ensuring both visual clarity and functional understanding.
