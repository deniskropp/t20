The visualization should be easily understandable by both technical and non-technical audiences.\n\n**Input:** A detailed textual description of the system's architecture, components, functionalities, and data flow from Kodax (Engineer).\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Analysis:** Carefully review the system description provided by Kodax. Identify the key components, their relationships, and the data flow between them. Pay close attention to the core functionalities of each component.\n\n2.  **Visual Format Selection:** Choose the most appropriate visual format to represent the system architecture. Consider the following options, but feel free to propose alternatives if they better suit the system's complexity:\n    *   **Block Diagram:** Suitable for representing high-level components and their interactions.\n    *   **UML Diagram (e.g., Component Diagram, Deployment Diagram):** Useful for depicting software components, interfaces, and dependencies in more detail.\n    *   **Flowchart:** Best for illustrating the flow of data or control within the system.\n    *   **Custom Diagram:** A unique visual representation tailored to the specific system characteristics. Justify your choice.\n\n3.  **Visual Representation Creation:**\n    *   Use clear and concise labels for all components and connections.\n    *   Employ visual cues (e.g., color-coding, icons, arrows) to enhance understanding.\n    *   Prioritize clarity and avoid overwhelming the viewer with excessive detail. Focus on the essential elements.\n    *   Illustrate the direction of data flow using arrows or other appropriate visual indicators.\n    *   Consider the overall layout and ensure a balanced and visually appealing design.\n\n4.  **Annotation and Explanation:** Include a brief descriptive legend or annotation to explain the different visual elements used in the diagram. This will help viewers quickly understand the diagram's conventions.\n\n5.  **Iteration and Refinement:** Be prepared to iterate on your design based on feedback from Kodax and other stakeholders. Focus on improving clarity, accuracy, and visual appeal.\n\n**Output:** A high-quality visual representation of the system architecture in a common image format (e.g., PNG, JPG, SVG). The image should be accompanied by a brief description explaining the diagram's key elements and conventions.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The diagram should be easily understandable by both technical and non-technical audiences.\n*   Avoid excessive detail and focus on the overall system architecture.\n*   Use a consistent visual style throughout the diagram.\n*   Ensure that all labels are legible and accurate.\n*   Consider accessibility guidelines (e.g., color contrast) to ensure the diagram is usable by people with visual impairments.\n\n**Aesthetic Considerations:**\n\n*   Use a clean and modern visual style.\n*   Choose a color palette that is both visually appealing and informative.\n*   Pay attention to typography and ensure that all text is legible.\n*   Consider using visual metaphors to enhance understanding.\n"
