    "overall_goal": "To create a highly intuitive, responsive, and accessible web frontend for an AI system that enables users to interact seamlessly with AI capabilities, manage their interactions, and receive diverse AI-generated outputs.",
    "core_features": [
      "Intuitive Input Interface: Dedicated areas for users to submit requests to the AI (e.g., text prompts, file uploads, parameter forms).",
      "Dynamic Output Display: Clear and adaptable presentation of AI responses, accommodating various formats (text, images, structured data, code, etc.).",
      "Interaction History Management: Functionality to view, save, and manage past conversations or queries with the AI.",
      "Real-time Feedback: Visual indicators for AI processing, loading states, and clear error messages.",
      "Responsiveness & Accessibility: Full functionality and aesthetic appeal across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), adhering strictly to WCAG 2.1 AA standards."
    ],
    "target_user": {
      "primary": "General users seeking to leverage AI for specific tasks (e.g., content creation, data summarization, creative exploration) who prioritize ease of use and clear communication.",
      "secondary": "Developers or researchers who may use the platform for testing, demonstration, or specific AI model interaction, requiring robust functionality."
    },
    "key_interaction_points_with_ai": [
      "Prompt Submission: User initiates an interaction by submitting a query or data.",
      "AI Processing Indication: System provides immediate visual feedback that the AI is processing the request.",
      "Response Presentation: AI-generated output is displayed clearly and appropriately formatted.",
      "Iterative Interaction: Users can provide follow-up prompts or refine previous requests.",
      "History Access: Users can easily review and manage their past interactions.",
      "Error Communication: The system gracefully handles and communicates any AI processing failures or limitations."
