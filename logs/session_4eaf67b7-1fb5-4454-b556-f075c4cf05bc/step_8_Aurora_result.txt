    "overall_assessment": "The implemented frontend components generally align well with the provided high-fidelity designs and style guide. Key elements like the Header, Sidebar structure, UserInputArea, and AIResponseDisplay have been implemented with attention to the specified styles and basic accessibility considerations. However, several discrepancies and areas for improvement have been identified to ensure complete adherence to the design and UX flow.",

        "description": "The wireframes indicate a collapsible sidebar, and the implementation notes mention it. However, the specific mechanism for collapsing/expanding (e.g., toggle button, swipe gesture) and its visual feedback (e.g., animation, overlay) needs to be explicitly implemented and verified against the design's intent for both desktop and mobile.",

        "description": "The style guide defines specific hover (`#E0E0E0`) and active states (`#2CA58D` background, `#FFFFFF` text color) for list items. It's crucial to verify that these exact styles are applied correctly when a conversation is hovered over or selected, and that the visual indication for the *currently active* conversation is clearly distinguishable.",
        "severity": "Medium",
        "recommendation": "Ensure hover and active state styles for conversation list items precisely match the style guide. Implement a clear visual indicator for the selected/active conversation."

The implementation needs to ensure that specific rendering logic is in place for images (with alt text), code blocks (with syntax highlighting if possible and language indication), and potential multimodal content, as outlined in the API contract and style guide.",
        "severity": "High",
        "recommendation": "Implement specific rendering logic within `AIResponseDisplay` (or child components) for `image`, `code`, and `multimodal` `response_type` values. Ensure accessibility features like alt text for images and proper code formatting are included."
