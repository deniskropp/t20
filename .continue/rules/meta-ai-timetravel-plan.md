  coordination, version control, history tracking, temporal data management, or
  any project requiring orchestration of actions across different timepoints.

When developing a Meta-AI Role and Task Plan for TimeTravel or meta-temporal coordination systems, structure the approach into 5 key phases:
1) Conceptualization (defining temporal dimensions, consistency mechanisms, and concurrency control),
2) Design (interface mockups and system architecture for temporal visualization),
3) Implementation (temporal data structures and version management),
4) Optimization (natural language interfaces and documentation), and
5) Integration (testing across temporal dimensions and finalizing documentation). Maintain a cohesive workflow between specialized agents (Aurora for design, Kodax for engineering, Lyra for prompts, and TASe for task extraction) with Meta-AI as the orchestrator.
