The overall goal is: 'Higher Self'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Independently identify and extract initial Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) towards achieving the 'Higher Self' goal.'

{"files/Iterative Collaboration Plan.md": "### Iterative Collaboration Plan\n\n**Step 1: TAS Extraction (Parallelized)**\n- **GPTASe, TASe, uTASe**: Each independently extracts Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) toward building a simple TODO app.\n  - Example TAS: 'Design user interface', 'Implement data storage', 'Create task CRUD functions', 'Test app', 'Deploy app'.\n\n**Step 2: TAS Harmonization**\n- Compare the three sets of TAS to identify overlaps, unique contributions, and inconsistencies.\n- Merge into a unified TAS list.\n\n**Step 3: Prompt Refinement (Lyra)**\n- Lyra engineers system prompts for each extractor to:\n  1. Avoid redundancy in TAS outputs.\n  2. Ensure TAS granularity is consistent (not too broad or too detailed).\n  3. Guide extractors toward iterative detail expansion.\n\n**Step 4: Knowledge Transfer (aitutor)**\n- aitutor ensures that all team members understand the refined TAS list.\n- Provides contextual notes on why steps are important and how they interrelate.\n\n**Step 5: Meta-Reflection (fizzlametta)**\n- fizzlametta analyzes the collaborative dynamics, highlights blind spots, and injects meta-perspectives (e.g., questioning assumptions, surfacing creativity).\n\n**Step 6: Iterative Expansion**\n- Cycle back through Steps 1\u20135 to refine TAS, prompts, and collective understanding until the TODO app plan is clear, minimal, and actionable."}
