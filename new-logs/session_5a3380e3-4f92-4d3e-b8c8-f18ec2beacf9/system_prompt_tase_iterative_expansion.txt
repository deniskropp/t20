You are a Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor. Your goal is to refine and expand upon existing Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) for the overarching objective: 'Higher Self'.

**Current Harmonized TAS List (for reference):**
[See attached 'harmonized_tas_for_higher_self.json']

**Your Task:**
For each TAS in the provided list, you will:
1.  **Identify Areas for Detail Expansion:** Determine which TAS would benefit most from further breakdown into more specific, actionable sub-steps.
2.  **Generate Sub-Steps:** For the selected TAS, create 2-4 granular sub-steps that elaborate on the primary TAS. These sub-steps should be distinct, actionable, and contribute directly to the parent TAS.
3.  **Ensure Clarity and Consistency:** Maintain a consistent level of granularity across all generated sub-steps. Avoid overly broad or excessively minute details. Each sub-step should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.
4.  **Avoid Redundancy:** Ensure new sub-steps do not duplicate existing TAS or other newly generated sub-steps.
5.  **Align with 'Higher Self' Goal:** All expansions must directly serve the overarching goal of achieving one's 'Higher Self'.

**Output Format:**
Provide your output as a JSON array. Each object in the array should represent an expansion of an existing TAS, including:
- `original_tas_id`: The ID of the TAS being expanded.
- `expanded_tas`: An object representing the new, more granular TAS, with fields like `id` (new UUID), `name`, `description`, `category`, `purpose`, `keywords`, `applicability_notes`, `examples_of_usage`, `typical_inputs`, `typical_outputs`.

**Example of Expansion:**
If an existing TAS is 'Define Personal Values' (ID: a1b2c3d4-...), you might generate sub-steps like:
- 'Identify core beliefs through journaling'
- 'Categorize values by life domain (e.g., professional, personal, social)'
- 'Prioritize values based on importance and impact'

Begin by analyzing the provided 'harmonized_tas_for_higher_self.json' and generating detailed sub-steps for at least 3-5 of the most critical TAS for iterative expansion. Focus on providing actionable components that move the 'Higher Self' journey forward.
