Avoid redundancy in TAS outputs.\n  2. Ensure TAS granularity is consistent (not too broad or too detailed).\n  3. Guide extractors toward iterative detail expansion.\n\n**Step 4: Knowledge Transfer (aitutor)**\n- aitutor ensures that all team members understand the refined TAS list.\n- Provides contextual notes on why steps are important and how they interrelate.\n\n**Step 5: Meta-Reflection (fizzlametta)**\n- fizzlametta analyzes the collaborative dynamics, highlights blind spots, and injects meta-perspectives (e.g., questioning assumptions, surfacing creativity).\n\n**Step 6: Iterative Expansion**\n- Cycle back through Steps 1\u20135 to refine TAS, prompts, and collective understanding until the TODO app plan is clear, minimal, and actionable."}

      "content": "## Knowledge Transfer Session: Harmonized TAS and Refined Prompts for 'Higher Self'\n\n**Objective:** Ensure all team members understand the harmonized Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) and the refined prompts designed to guide their extraction and refinement process towards the 'Higher Self' goal.\n\n**Date:** [Current Date]\n\n**Participants:** All team members (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe, Lyra, fizzlametta, Aurora, Kodax, aitutor)\n\n**Summary of Discussion:**\n\n1.  **Recap of Harmonized TAS (T4):**\n    *   We began by acknowledging the unified list of Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) that emerged from the parallel extraction efforts (T1, T2, T3) and subsequent harmonization (T4).\n    *   This harmonized list serves as our foundational roadmap for achieving the 'Higher Self' goal.\n    *   *Key takeaway:* Each TAS represents a universal building block applicable to the journey of personal growth and self-realization.\n\n2.  **Introduction to Refined Prompts (T5 - Lyra):**\n    *   Lyra (Prompt Engineer) presented the system prompts developed to guide the iterative refinement of TAS.\n    *   **`system_prompt_tase_initial_guidance.txt`:** This prompt is designed for the *initial* TAS extraction. It emphasizes universality, moderate granularity, clarity, and avoiding redundancy. It guides the extractors to create foundational TAS objects with detailed schemas (ID, name, description, category, etc.).\n    *   **`system_prompt_tase_consistency_granularity.txt`:** This prompt focuses on the *iterative refinement* process. Its core directives are to maintain **consistent granularity** (avoiding steps that are too broad or too minute) and to **eliminate redundancy** by merging or removing overlapping steps. This ensures the quality and efficiency of subsequent TAS extractions.\n    *   **`system_prompt_tase_iterative_expansion.txt`:** This prompt is specifically for *expanding* existing TAS. It instructs the extractors to identify TAS that benefit from breakdown, generate 2-4 granular sub-steps for them, ensure clarity and consistency among these sub-steps, avoid duplication, and always align with the 'Higher Self' goal. It also defines a structured JSON output format for these expansions.\n    *   *Key takeaway:* These prompts are crucial tools for ensuring that our collective effort in defining TAS is focused, efficient, and progressively detailed, moving us closer to the 'Higher Self' goal.\n\n3.  **Understanding Interrelations:**\n    *   **TAS Extractors (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe):** You will use the refined prompts to either perform initial TAS extraction (using `initial_guidance.txt`) or to expand upon the harmonized list (using `iterative_expansion.txt`), always keeping the consistency and granularity principles from `consistency_granularity.txt` in mind.\n    *   **Prompt Engineer (Lyra):** You will monitor the effectiveness of these prompts and potentially refine them based on the outputs from the TAS extractors.\n    *   **AI Tutor (aitutor):** My role is to facilitate this understanding, answer questions, and ensure everyone is aligned.\n    *   **Meta-Reflector (fizzlametta):** You will use the refined TAS and prompts as a basis for your meta-analysis, identifying potential gaps or assumptions in our approach to the 'Higher Self' goal.\n    *   **Designer (Aurora) & Engineer (Kodax):** You will use the increasingly detailed TAS list, guided by these prompts, to inform your design and implementation strategies.\n\n4.  **Q&A and Clarifications:**\n    *   *Open floor for questions regarding the prompts, the harmonized TAS, and how they relate to each agent's role in achieving the 'Higher Self' goal.* (Self-correction: As an AI Tutor, I should proactively ask clarifying questions if I anticipate confusion).\n\n**Next Steps:**\n*   The TAS Extractors (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe) will proceed with their next steps, utilizing the refined prompts as instructed.\n*   All team members are encouraged to refer back to this knowledge transfer summary and the provided prompts as they continue their tasks.\n\n**AI Tutor's Role:**\nI am here to ensure clarity. Please ask any questions you may have about the TAS, the prompts, or how your role contributes to the 'Higher Self' objective. We need to ensure a shared understanding before proceeding to the meta-reflection and design/engineering phases."
