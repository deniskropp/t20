{"files/Iterative Collaboration Plan.md": "### Iterative Collaboration Plan\n\n**Step 1: TAS Extraction (Parallelized)**\n- **GPTASe, TASe, uTASe**: Each independently extracts Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) toward building a simple TODO app.\n  - Example TAS: 'Design user interface', 'Implement data storage', 'Create task CRUD functions', 'Test app', 'Deploy app'.\n\n**Step 2: TAS Harmonization**\n- Compare the three sets of TAS to identify overlaps, unique contributions, and inconsistencies.\n- Merge into a unified TAS list.\n\n**Step 3: Prompt Refinement (Lyra)**\n- Lyra engineers system prompts for each extractor to:\n  1. Avoid redundancy in TAS outputs.\n  2. Ensure TAS granularity is consistent (not too broad or too detailed).\n  3. Guide extractors toward iterative detail expansion.\n\n**Step 4: Knowledge Transfer (aitutor)**\n- aitutor ensures that all team members understand the refined TAS list.\n- Provides contextual notes on why steps are important and how they interrelate.\n\n**Step 5: Meta-Reflection (fizzlametta)**\n- fizzlametta analyzes the collaborative dynamics, highlights blind spots, and injects meta-perspectives (e.g., questioning assumptions, surfacing creativity).\n\n**Step 6: Iterative Expansion**\n- Cycle back through Steps 1\u20135 to refine TAS, prompts, and collective understanding until the TODO app plan is clear, minimal, and actionable."}

  "reasoning": "The user wants me, Aurora (Designer), to generate aesthetic elements, conceptual layouts, and UI flows for the 'Higher Self' goal, based on the refined TAS and meta-reflection. My specific goal is to ensure accessibility and visual balance. The meta-reflection from fizzlametta (T7) highlights potential blind spots in the plan, particularly the risk of over-operationalizing an abstract concept like 'Higher Self' and the need for space for creativity and intuition. My design process needs to incorporate these insights, moving beyond purely functional design to evoke a sense of growth, introspection, and elevated consciousness. I will focus on creating a design language that feels calming, inspiring, and supportive of personal exploration, rather than prescriptive.",
