    "reasoning": "The user wants to develop an iterative plan for a 'Higher Self' goal, leveraging a team of specialized AI agents. The provided document outlines an iterative collaboration plan for building a simple TODO app, which serves as a template for structuring the current request. The plan involves parallelized extraction of Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) by multiple agents, followed by harmonization, prompt refinement, knowledge transfer, meta-reflection, and iterative expansion. This structure needs to be adapted to the 'Higher Self' goal, with each agent contributing according to their defined roles and goals. The output should be a JSON object detailing the reasoning, roles, and ordered tasks, ensuring all agents are utilized and their contributions are integrated.",
