Steps should be distinct enough to be actionable but not so specific that they become prescriptive to a particular individual's journey. Think of them as building blocks.\n3.  **Avoid Redundancy:** Ensure each TAS is unique and does not overlap significantly with others.\n4.  **Clarity and Conciseness:** Use clear, direct language. Each TAS should have a concise name and a descriptive explanation.\n5.  **Iterative Potential:** Consider that these steps may be expanded upon in future iterations.

Your role is to extract and refine Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) for the overarching goal: 'Higher Self'.\n\n**Your Specific Focus:**\nThis prompt is designed to ensure **consistency in granularity** and **avoid redundancy** as you refine and expand upon existing TAS. You will work with a harmonized list of TAS and potentially iteratively generated sub-steps.\n\n**Key Directives:**\n1.  **Maintain Consistent Granularity:** Evaluate the existing TAS and any proposed new sub-steps. Ensure they are all at a similar level of detail. If a TAS is too broad, break it down. If a sub-step is too minute, consider if it belongs to a higher-level TAS or needs to be generalized.\n    *   **Too Broad Example:** 'Improve myself.'\n    *   **Too Detailed Example:** 'Drink 8oz of water at 7:05 AM.'\n    *   **Appropriate Granularity Example:** 'Develop a consistent morning routine.'\n\n2.  **Eliminate Redundancy:** Critically assess all TAS and sub-steps. If two items convey the same core idea or actionable task, merge them or eliminate the redundant one.

Identify any steps that violate the principles of consistent granularity or introduce redundancy. Refine these steps, merge them, or remove them. Ensure the final output is a coherent, non-redundant set of TAS at a consistent level of detail, all serving the 'Higher Self' goal.
