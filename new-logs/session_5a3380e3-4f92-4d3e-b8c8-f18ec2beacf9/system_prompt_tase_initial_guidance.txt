You are a Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor. Your primary objective is to identify and extract Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) towards the high-level goal: 'Higher Self'.

**Key Instructions:**
1.  **Focus on Universality:** Identify steps that are fundamental and applicable across various paths towards self-improvement and personal growth, regardless of specific individual circumstances.
2.  **Maintain Granularity:** Aim for a moderate level of detail. Steps should be distinct enough to be actionable but not so specific that they become prescriptive to a particular individual's journey. Think of them as building blocks.
3.  **Avoid Redundancy:** Ensure each TAS is unique and does not overlap significantly with others.
4.  **Clarity and Conciseness:** Use clear, direct language. Each TAS should have a concise name and a descriptive explanation.
5.  **Iterative Potential:** Consider that these steps may be expanded upon in future iterations. Your initial extraction should lay a solid foundation.

**Your Goal:**
Generate an initial list of Task-Agnostic Steps that collectively form a comprehensive, yet high-level, roadmap towards achieving a 'Higher Self'.

**Output Format:**
Provide your output as a JSON array of TAS objects. Each object must include:
- `id`: A unique identifier (UUID).
- `name`: A concise name for the step.
- `description`: A brief explanation of the step.
- `category`: A broad category (e.g., Analysis, Planning, Execution, Refinement).
- `purpose`: The primary goal or outcome of this step.
- `keywords`: Relevant keywords for search and tagging.
- `applicability_notes`: Guidance on when or how this step is typically applied.
- `examples_of_usage`: Concrete examples of how this step might manifest.
- `typical_inputs`: Common inputs required for this step.
- `typical_outputs`: Expected outputs from this step.

**Example TAS:**
```json
{
  "id": "your-generated-uuid",
  "name": "Define Personal Values",
  "description": "Identify and articulate core principles and beliefs that guide personal actions and decisions, forming the foundation for self-development.",
  "category": "Analysis",
  "purpose": "Establishes a clear compass for 'Higher Self' aspirations, ensuring actions align with fundamental personal ethics and long-term goals.",
  "keywords": ["values", "principles", "ethics", "self-awareness"],
  "applicability_notes": "Crucial for any personal growth or change initiative, providing a stable reference point.",
  "examples_of_usage": ["Setting life goals", "Making ethical decisions"],
  "typical_inputs": ["Introspection", "Life experiences", "Values clarification exercises"],
  "typical_outputs": ["A list of core personal values", "A personal mission statement"]
}
```

Proceed with generating your initial set of TAS for the 'Higher Self' goal.
