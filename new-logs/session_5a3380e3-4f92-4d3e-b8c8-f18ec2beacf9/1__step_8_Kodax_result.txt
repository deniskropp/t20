Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the technical implementation strategy for the 'Higher Self' project, focusing on modularity, performance, and accessibility, guided by Aurora's design concepts and the overall project goals. The aim is to create a responsive, intuitive, and inspiring user experience.\n\n## 2. Core Technologies\n\n*   **Frontend Framework**: **React** (or Vue.js)\n    *   **Rationale**: Component-based architecture naturally supports modularity. Strong community support, extensive ecosystem, and excellent performance characteristics make it ideal for building complex, interactive UIs.\n*   **State Management**: **Context API / Zustand** (or Pinia for Vue)\n    *   **Rationale**: For simpler state needs, React's Context API or Zustand offer lightweight solutions. For more complex global state, these provide scalable and performant options without the boilerplate of Redux. This aligns with the goal of keeping the solution simple yet effective.\n*   **Styling**: **CSS Modules / Styled-Components** (with a focus on CSS Variables)\n    *   **Rationale**: CSS Modules provide local scoping, enhancing modularity and preventing style conflicts. Styled-Components offer a dynamic approach. Crucially, **CSS Variables** will be used extensively to implement Aurora's color palette and typography system, allowing for easy theming and consistency across the application.\n*   **Build Tool**: **Vite**\n    *   **Rationale**: Offers extremely fast cold server starts and Hot Module Replacement (HMR), significantly improving developer experience and iteration speed. It's modern and efficient.\n*   **Accessibility Tools**: **Axe-core**, **Lighthouse**\n    *   **Rationale**: Integrate automated accessibility testing into the development workflow to catch issues early.\n\n## 3. Architectural Approach: Component-Based Modularity\n\n*   **Atomic Design Principles**: Organize components into Atoms (e.g., Button, Input), Molecules (e.g., Form Field), Organisms (e.g., Header, Inquiry Card), and Templates/Pages.\n*   **Feature-Based Modules**: Group related components and logic into feature modules (e.g., `inquiry`, `journal`, `profile`). This enhances maintainability and scalability.\n*   **Reusable UI Kit**: Develop a dedicated `ui-kit` or `components` library encapsulating all UI elements defined in Aurora's design. This ensures consistency and adherence to the design system.\n\n## 4. Implementing Aurora's Design Concepts\n\n*   **Color Palette & Typography**: Implement the defined colors and fonts using CSS Variables. Ensure responsive typography scaling as specified.\n    *   Example:\n        ```css\n        :root {\n          --color-primary: #A8D8FF; /* Serene Sky */\n          --color-secondary: #F5E6CC; /* Earthy Dawn */\n          --font-heading: 'Lora', serif;\n          --font-body: 'Inter', sans-serif;\n        }\n        ```\n*   **Logo Concept ('The Ascending Seed')**: Implement as an SVG component, ensuring it's scalable and accessible (e.g., with appropriate ARIA attributes if interactive).\n*   **UI Flow - 'Guided Inquiry'**: \n    *   Develop `InquiryCard` component adhering to the design.\n    *   Implement a spacious layout with generous white space.\n    *   Use subtle animations (e.g., fade-ins, parallax) via libraries like Framer Motion or simple CSS transitions.\n    *   Ensure journaling and affirmation selection are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.\n*   **UI Flow - 'Personalized Growth Path'**: \n    *   Requires a dynamic visualization component. This could involve SVG or a canvas library, depending on complexity. Start with simpler SVG-based elements.\n    *   Focus on clear visual hierarchy and semantic structure for accessibility.\n\n## 5. Accessibility Considerations (Integrated from the start)\n\n*   **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, etc.) to provide structure for assistive technologies.\n*   **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard. Implement clear focus indicators.\n*   **ARIA Roles and Attributes**: Use ARIA where necessary to enhance semantics for custom components or dynamic content (e.g., for modal dialogs, custom form controls).\n*   **Color Contrast**: Adhere strictly to WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios, using the defined palette as a base and verifying with contrast checking tools.\n*   **Scalable Text**: Ensure text can be resized without loss of content or functionality.\n*   **Testing**: Regularly test with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) and automated tools (Axe, Lighthouse).\n\n## 6. Modularity & Performance\n\n*   **Code Splitting**: Utilize Vite's built-in code splitting capabilities to load only necessary JavaScript chunks for each route or feature.\n*   **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for components and images, especially for features not immediately visible on page load.\n*   **Optimization**: Optimize assets (images, fonts). Minify code during the build process.\n*   **Component Reusability**: Enforce the use of the shared UI Kit to prevent redundant code and ensure consistency.\n\n## 7. Next Steps\n\n*   Set up the project structure with Vite and React.\n*   Implement the core `ui-kit` based on Aurora's `aurora_design_kit.json`.\n*   Begin developing the foundational components for the 'Guided Inquiry' flow.\n*   Establish automated accessibility checks in the CI/CD pipeline (if applicable) or local development environment."
