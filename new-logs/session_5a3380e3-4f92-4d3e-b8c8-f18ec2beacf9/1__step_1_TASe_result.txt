  "reasoning": "The user wants to identify Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) for the high-level goal 'Higher Self'. As a TAS extractor, my sub-task is to independently identify and extract these initial steps. I will break down the abstract concept of 'Higher Self' into fundamental, reusable actions that could apply across various domains. I will focus on the 'how' rather than the 'what' specific to personal development or spirituality. The steps should be action-oriented, general, and independent. I will then format these steps into the required JSON structure, ensuring each field is populated according to the conceptual framework and schema, including a unique ID, name, description, category, and purpose. I will use UUIDs for IDs and select appropriate categories like 'Exploration', 'Integration', 'Cultivation', 'Reflection'.",
