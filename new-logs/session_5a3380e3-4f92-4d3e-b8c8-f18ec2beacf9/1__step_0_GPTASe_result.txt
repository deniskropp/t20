  "reasoning": "The user wants to identify Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) for the high-level goal of 'Higher Self'. My role is to extract these initial TAS. Based on the provided iterative collaboration plan structure, which uses a TODO app as an example, I need to abstract the core actions required to move towards a 'Higher Self' state. These steps should be general enough to apply to personal development, learning, or any self-improvement endeavor, avoiding domain-specific jargon. The initial steps should focus on understanding, defining, planning, and initiating actions related to self-improvement.",
  "output": "The output is a JSON array containing Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) relevant to the 'Higher Self' goal. These steps are designed to be abstract and applicable across various self-improvement contexts.",
