## High-Level System Architecture: Self-Loading & Service Respawning Script

This architecture outlines the core components and their interactions for a Python script designed to load itself and manage the lifecycle of other services.

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Orchestrator (Main Script):**
    *   **Responsibility:** The central control unit. Manages its own lifecycle, loads its configuration, monitors services, and initiates respawning.
    *   **Functionality:** 
        *   Self-initiation and management (potentially using `sys.executable` for full replacement).
        *   Configuration loading.
        *   Service monitoring loop.
        *   Graceful shutdown handling.
        *   Logging aggregation.
*   **Configuration Manager:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Reads, parses, and provides service definitions and restart policies from a configuration source.
    *   **Functionality:** 
        *   Supports formats like JSON, YAML, or INI.
        *   Defines: Service name, executable path, arguments, monitoring interval, restart strategy (e.g., max retries, backoff delay), dependencies.
*   **Service Monitor:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Periodically checks the status of each configured service.
    *   **Functionality:** 
        *   Uses `psutil` or `subprocess` to check process status (PID, running state).
        *   Detects service failures (crashes, unexpected exits).
        *   Reports status changes to the Orchestrator.
*   **Service Manager:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Handles the starting, stopping, and restarting of managed services.
    *   **Functionality:** 
        *   Uses `subprocess.Popen` to launch services.
        *   Implements restart logic based on policies from the Configuration Manager (e.g., retry delays, rate limiting to prevent loops).
        *   Handles graceful shutdown signals.
*   **Logger:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Centralized logging for all script activities and managed services.
    *   **Functionality:** 
        *   Logs events: script startup/shutdown, configuration loading, service status changes, respawn attempts, errors.
        *   Can output to console, files, or a remote logging service.
*   **Dynamic Loader (Optional/Advanced):**
    *   **Responsibility:** If the script needs to modify its *own* behavior at runtime (beyond just restarting), this component would handle dynamic code loading.
    *   **Functionality:** 
        *   Uses `importlib` to load new modules or reload existing ones.
        *   *Note: This adds significant complexity and potential instability; often, a simple restart of the script is sufficient.*

**2. Interactions:**

1.  **Initialization:** The Orchestrator starts. It loads its configuration via the Configuration Manager.
2.  **Monitoring Loop:** The Orchestrator instructs the Service Monitor to check services at defined intervals.
3.  **Status Check:** The Service Monitor queries the status of each service (using `psutil` or `subprocess`).
4.  **Failure Detection:** If the Service Monitor detects a failure, it reports back to the Orchestrator.
5.  **Respawn Trigger:** The Orchestrator instructs the Service Manager to respawn the failed service, applying restart policies (delay, retries).
6.  **Service Operation:** The Service Manager uses `subprocess.Popen` to start the service. The Orchestrator logs these actions via the Logger.
7.  **Shutdown:** When a shutdown signal is received, the Orchestrator instructs the Service Manager to stop all managed services gracefully before shutting down itself.
8.  **Self-Respawn (Script):** If the Orchestrator itself crashes, an external mechanism (like `systemd`, `supervisor`, or a parent process) would be responsible for restarting the Orchestrator script. Alternatively, the Orchestrator could use `os.exec*` to replace itself upon detecting a critical internal failure, initiating a new instance with the same logic.

**3. Technology Choices & Integration Points:**

*   **Core Logic:** Python standard libraries (`subprocess`, `os`, `sys`, `importlib` if needed, `logging`, `threading`/`asyncio` for concurrency).
*   **Process Management:** `subprocess` for launching and interacting with services. `psutil` for cross-platform process status checks.
*   **Configuration:** JSON or YAML files parsed with `json` or `PyYAML` libraries.
*   **External Management (Optional but Recommended):** For robust self-respawning of the *Orchestrator script itself*, consider using `systemd` (Linux) or `supervisor` to manage the Orchestrator process. This offloads the highest level of process supervision.
