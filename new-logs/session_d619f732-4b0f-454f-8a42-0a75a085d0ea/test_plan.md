# Test Plan for Self-Loading and Service Respawning Script

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the test plan for the Python script designed to load itself and respawn managed services. The script, `integrated_script.py`, combines self-loading capabilities with robust service management, including automatic respawning on failure. This plan details the strategy for testing its functionality, reliability, and performance.

**2. Objectives**
*   Verify that the script can successfully load and manage services based on provided configurations.
*   Ensure that services are automatically respawned upon failure according to defined policies.
*   Validate the script's self-respawning mechanism.
*   Assess the script's performance and resource utilization under various conditions.
*   Confirm graceful shutdown procedures.
*   Ensure adherence to the defined metrics (from T15).

**3. Scope**
*   **In Scope:**
    *   Unit tests for individual components (e.g., `ServiceManager` methods).
    *   Integration tests for the interaction between self-loading and service management.
    *   Functional tests for service start, stop, and respawn policies (`always`, `on-failure`).
    *   Tests for the self-respawn functionality (`os.execv`).
    *   Stress tests to evaluate behavior under high load and failure conditions.
    *   Resource usage monitoring (CPU, Memory).
    *   Graceful shutdown testing.
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Testing of the individual services being managed (assumed to be tested separately).
    *   Network-level testing of managed services (unless directly related to the script's management).
    *   Security vulnerability testing (beyond basic robustness).

**4. Test Strategy**

The testing will be conducted in phases, progressing from isolated unit tests to end-to-end integration and stress tests.

**4.1. Unit Tests**
*   **Objective:** To verify the correctness of individual components and functions in isolation.
*   **Components to Test:**
    *   `ServiceManager` class methods:
        *   `start_service()`: Test starting a service, including handling existing processes and initial errors.
        *   `stop_service()`: Test stopping running and non-running services, including graceful termination and forceful killing.
        *   `monitor_services()`: Test detection of service termination and application of restart policies (always, on-failure).
        *   `run_monitoring()`: Test the monitoring loop's basic operation and exit condition.
        *   `shutdown()`: Test stopping all managed services.
    *   `respawn_self()` function: Mock `os.execv` to verify it's called correctly with appropriate arguments.
    *   `log()` function: Verify correct formatting and output.
*   **Tools:** `unittest` or `pytest` framework.
*   **Methodology:** Mocking external dependencies such as `subprocess.Popen`, `os.killpg`, and `signal` where necessary.

**4.2. Integration Tests**
*   **Objective:** To verify the interaction between the self-loading mechanism, the `ServiceManager`, and the underlying operating system processes.
*   **Methodology:** Run the `integrated_script.py` script in a controlled environment. Use `subprocess` to launch the script and then interact with it by sending signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM) or by manually terminating the child processes it spawns. Monitor the script's output logs and resource usage.
*   **Key Scenarios:**
    *   **Successful Service Startup & Monitoring:** Start the script and verify that all defined services (`example_service_1`, `example_service_2`, `failing_service_demo`) are started successfully and appear in `ServiceManager.processes`.
    *   **`on-failure` Respawn:** Manually terminate `failing_service_demo` (which is configured to fail) and verify that it is restarted according to its policy (max 3 retries, 3s delay).
    *   **`always` Respawn:** Manually terminate `example_service_1` and verify it is restarted immediately.
    *   **Max Retries Reached:** Trigger `failing_service_demo` to fail repeatedly until `max_retries` is reached. Verify it stops being monitored and doesn't consume excessive resources.
    *   **Graceful Shutdown:** Send SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or SIGTERM to the main script. Verify that all managed services are stopped gracefully before the main script exits.
    *   **Self-Respawn:** Simulate a critical error in the main loop (e.g., by raising an exception). Verify that `respawn_self` is called and the script restarts itself.
*   **Tools:** `pytest`, `subprocess`, `signal`, `psutil`.

**4.3. Stress Tests**
*   **Objective:** To evaluate the script's stability, performance, and resource usage under sustained load and adverse conditions.
*   **Methodology:** Employ automated testing scripts and system monitoring tools (`psutil`, `top`, etc.) to simulate high load and failure scenarios over extended periods.
*   **Key Scenarios:**
    *   **High Number of Services:** Configure the script to manage a large number of services (e.g., 50-100) and monitor startup time, memory usage, and CPU load.
    *   **Rapid Failures:** Configure multiple services to fail simultaneously or in quick succession. Monitor respawn latency, success rate, and system resource contention.
    *   **Long-Term Running:** Let the script run for an extended period (e.g., 24-72 hours) with a mix of stable and failing services. Monitor for memory leaks, performance degradation, and uptime of managed services.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Simulate resource constraints (e.g., low memory, high CPU) on the host system and observe how the script and its managed services behave.
    *   **Rapid Restart Loops:** Intentionally configure a service to fail immediately upon startup and test the `max_retries` mechanism under high frequency.
*   **Tools:** Load generation tools (if applicable), system monitoring tools (`top`, `htop`, `psutil`), custom scripts to trigger failures.

**5. Test Environment**
*   **Operating System:** Linux (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04+), macOS, Windows (with consideration for process management differences).
*   **Python Version:** Python 3.8+
*   **Dependencies:** Standard Python libraries. Ensure dummy service files (`example_service_1.py`, `example_service_2.py`, `failing_script.py`) are present or generated.
*   **Tools:** `pytest`, `psutil`.

**6. Test Deliverables**

*   Unit test suite (e.g., `test_service_manager.py`).
*   Integration test scripts.
*   Stress test scripts and configurations.
*   Test execution reports, including logs and performance data.
*   Bug reports and issue tracking.
*   Final test summary report.
