  "reasoning": "The specific sub-task is to 'Integrate the self-loading and service respawning components, ensuring seamless operation.' I have received outputs from the 'System Integrator' (T11) which implemented the self-loading logic in `self_loader.py`, and from the 'Technical Expert' (T12) which provided a `ServiceManager` class in `service_manager.py` for handling service respawning. My role as 'System Integrator' is to combine these two pieces of functionality. This will involve modifying `self_loader.py` to incorporate or utilize the `ServiceManager` class to manage the services that it dynamically loads. The goal is to have a single script that can both load itself (potentially reloading or restarting) and manage the lifecycle of other services it's responsible for, including respawning them if they fail. I will modify `self_loader.py` to instantiate and use the `ServiceManager` class, passing it the service configurations that should be loaded and managed. This integration will ensure that the self-loading mechanism and the service respawning mechanism work together harmoniously, fulfilling the sub-task requirement of seamless operation.",
  "output": "The Python script `integrated_script.py` now combines the self-loading capabilities with robust service respawning. It dynamically imports service modules and then uses a `ServiceManager` to oversee their lifecycle, including automatic respawning on failure. This integration ensures that the script can manage its own execution flow while also reliably maintaining the operational status of its dependent services, achieving seamless operation as required by the sub-task.",
