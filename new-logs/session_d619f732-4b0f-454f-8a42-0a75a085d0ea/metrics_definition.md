# Metrics for Evaluating the Python Script

To effectively evaluate the performance, reliability, and resource usage of the self-loading and service-respawning Python script, the following metrics are proposed:

## 1. Performance Metrics:

*   **Respawn Latency:** The time taken from detecting a service failure to successfully respawning the service. This measures the script's responsiveness.
    *   *Measurement:* Average, median, and maximum time (in seconds) for respawn operations.
*   **Script Startup Time:** The time it takes for the main Python script to initialize and begin monitoring services.
    *   *Measurement:* Average and maximum startup time (in seconds).
*   **Monitoring Overhead:** The computational resources consumed by the script for actively monitoring services.
    *   *Measurement:* CPU and memory usage of the script process itself during idle and active monitoring states.
*   **Configuration Load Time:** The time required to load and parse the service configuration.
    *   *Measurement:* Average and maximum time (in milliseconds) for configuration loading.

## 2. Reliability Metrics:

*   **Uptime of Managed Services:** The percentage of time that the services managed by the script are operational.
    *   *Measurement:* (Total Uptime / Total Time) * 100% for each managed service.
*   **Respawn Success Rate:** The percentage of successful service respawn attempts out of all detected failures.
    *   *Measurement:* (Successful Respawns / Total Respawn Attempts) * 100%.
*   **Failure Detection Rate:** The accuracy with which the script detects actual service failures.
    *   *Measurement:* Percentage of actual failures correctly identified.
*   **False Positive Rate:** The rate at which the script incorrectly identifies a healthy service as failed.
    *   *Measurement:* (False Positives / Total Checks) * 100%.
*   **Infinite Loop Prevention Effectiveness:** Measures how often the script avoids getting stuck in restart loops for problematic services.
    *   *Measurement:* Number of instances where restart limits were hit and the service was correctly marked as non-recoverable, preventing further attempts.
*   **Graceful Shutdown Success Rate:** The percentage of successful graceful shutdowns of the script and its managed services.
    *   *Measurement:* (Successful Graceful Shutdowns / Total Shutdown Initiations) * 100%.

## 3. Resource Usage Metrics:

*   **CPU Utilization:** The percentage of CPU consumed by the Python script process.
    *   *Measurement:* Average, peak, and steady-state CPU usage (%).
*   **Memory Footprint:** The amount of RAM utilized by the Python script process.
    *   *Measurement:* Resident Set Size (RSS) and Virtual Memory Size (VMS) in MB/GB.
*   **I/O Operations:** The number of read/write operations performed by the script, particularly related to logging and service interaction.
    *   *Measurement:* Disk read/write operations per second.
*   **Network Usage:** If services involve network communication, monitor the script's network activity (though likely minimal for the core logic).
    *   *Measurement:* Network bandwidth consumed (if applicable).

## 4. Logging and Auditing Metrics:

*   **Log Volume:** The amount of data generated by the script's logging.
    *   *Measurement:* Size of log files (MB/GB) over a period, number of log entries per hour/day.
*   **Log Completeness:** Ensuring all critical events (starts, stops, failures, respawns) are logged.
    *   *Measurement:* Manual audit or automated checks against expected event logs.

These metrics will provide a quantitative basis for understanding the script's effectiveness, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring it meets the desired outcomes of high availability and automated recovery without negatively impacting system resources.
