  "reasoning": "The user wants me to implement the core logic for a Python script to load itself and potentially use dynamic import mechanisms. I have been provided with Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) from previous tasks (T8 and T9) that outline the general actions needed for system design and implementation. My sub-task is to focus on the 'self-loading' aspect. I will create a Python script that demonstrates this by using `importlib` to dynamically import modules, and potentially uses `sys.executable` and `os.execv` to achieve a form of self-reloading or respawning. This directly addresses the requirement of 'implement the core logic for the Python script to load itself'. The output will be a Python script file.",
  "output": "The Python script `self_loader.py` implements the core logic for dynamically loading modules and a basic mechanism for self-respawning using `os.execv`. It demonstrates how a script can effectively 'load itself' in a controlled manner, which is a foundational step for the overall goal of creating a script that can load itself and respawn services.",
