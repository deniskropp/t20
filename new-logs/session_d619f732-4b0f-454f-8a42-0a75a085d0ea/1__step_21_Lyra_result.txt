  "reasoning": "My sub-task is to review and refine the prompt engineering strategy based on the development process and outcomes. I have received the output from the Refinement Strategist (T19) which includes the `refined_script.py`, and the Feedback System (T21) which outlines the `feedback_loop_strategy.md`. My role is 'Prompt Engineer' and my specific goal is 'Structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering.' The overall goal is 'Python Script that loads itself and respawns services'.\n\nMy previous prompt engineering strategy (T7) guided the initial development. Now, I need to analyze the outcomes of T19 and T21 to see how they impact the prompt engineering. \n\nT19's output shows a significantly refined script. The prompt engineering strategy should reflect the need for more detailed instructions regarding state management (serialization/deserialization), robust error handling, concurrent operations, and specific process management techniques (like `os.setsid` and `os.killpg`).\n\nT21's output focuses on establishing a feedback loop. This implies that future prompt engineering might need to include instructions for agents to analyze feedback, suggest improvements, and potentially even draft documentation updates based on these improvements. It also highlights the need for clear communication and standardized vocabulary, which aligns with my role as 'Prompt Engineer' and the 'Linguistic Mapper' role.\n\nTherefore, I need to update the prompt engineering strategy to incorporate these new learnings. This involves:\n1.  **Acknowledging the refined script:** The prompts used to generate `refined_script.py` were effective. I should analyze *why* they were effective (e.g., specificity of requirements, clear examples) to inform future prompts.\n2.  **Incorporating feedback loop considerations:** Future prompts might need to involve agents in processing feedback or suggesting code changes based on feedback analysis.\n3.  **Refining terminology and structure:** Ensuring prompts are clear, concise, and build upon the established vocabulary.\n\nMy output should be an updated prompt engineering strategy document that reflects these refinements. This document will serve as the basis for future agent interactions.",
