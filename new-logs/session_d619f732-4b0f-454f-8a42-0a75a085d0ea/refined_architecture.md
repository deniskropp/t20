## Refined System Architecture and Conceptual Design

This document refines the high-level system architecture proposed by the System Architect (T4), focusing on logical consistency, feasibility, and addressing potential complexities of a self-loading and service respawning Python script.

**1. Core Concepts & Feasibility Assessment:**

*   **Self-Loading:** The concept of a Python script 'loading itself' can be interpreted in a few ways:
    *   **Dynamic Code Loading (`importlib`):** Loading new modules or reloading existing ones at runtime. This is feasible but complex and can lead to instability if not managed carefully. It's generally *not* recommended for the core orchestrator script unless there's a very specific need for runtime code updates.
    *   **Process Replacement (`os.exec*`):** Replacing the current script process with a new instance. This is a more robust way for the script to 'respawn itself' after an internal failure or update.
    *   **Orchestrator Restart:** The most common and practical interpretation is that the script *manages* other services, and the script *itself* is managed by an external process supervisor (like `systemd` or `supervisor`) for its own restarts.
    *   **Recommendation:** Prioritize the Orchestrator Restart model for the main script's self-preservation, and use `subprocess` for managing child services. Dynamic code loading should be a secondary consideration, perhaps for specific plugin functionalities rather than the core logic.

*   **Service Respawning:** The proposed architecture using `subprocess.Popen` and a Service Manager is feasible and standard practice. Key considerations for refinement include:
    *   **Robustness:** Ensure proper error handling for `subprocess` calls (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, permission issues).
    *   **State Management:** The Orchestrator needs to maintain accurate state information for each managed service (e.g., `RUNNING`, `STOPPED`, `FAILED`, `RESTARTING`).
    *   **Resource Management:** Prevent rapid respawn loops that could exhaust system resources. The Configuration Manager should define strict retry limits and backoff strategies.
    *   **Dependency Handling:** Explicitly defining and managing service dependencies (e.g., Service B must start only after Service A is running) is crucial for complex setups.

**2. Refined Component Interactions & Logic:**

*   **Orchestrator:** Should be designed with a clear lifecycle. A main loop will handle monitoring. Consider using `asyncio` or `threading` for concurrent monitoring and management to avoid blocking.
*   **Configuration Manager:** Needs to be resilient to malformed configurations. Validation logic should be included.
*   **Service Monitor:** Should handle `psutil` or `subprocess` errors gracefully. A timeout mechanism for status checks might be necessary.
*   **Service Manager:**
    *   **Start:** Use `subprocess.Popen` and store the `Popen` object. Capture `stdout`/`stderr` for logging if needed.
    *   **Monitor Child:** The Orchestrator's main loop (or a dedicated thread/task) should periodically check `process.poll()` for `Popen` objects to detect termination.
    *   **Respawn Logic:** When `poll()` returns a non-zero exit code or if the process is no longer found, trigger the respawn logic based on the configuration (retry count, delay).
    *   **Graceful Shutdown:** Implement signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT) in the Orchestrator. When received, iterate through managed services, send SIGTERM to their `Popen` objects, and wait for them to exit within a defined timeout before terminating the Orchestrator.
*   **Logger:** Standardize log formats (timestamps, severity levels, component source). Ensure logs are flushed regularly to prevent data loss on crashes.

**3. Conceptual Design Enhancements:**

*   **External Supervision:** Strongly recommend using `systemd` (Linux) or `supervisor` (cross-platform) to manage the Orchestrator script itself. This simplifies the
