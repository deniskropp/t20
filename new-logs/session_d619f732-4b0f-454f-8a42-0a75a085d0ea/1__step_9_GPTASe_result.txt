  "reasoning": "The user wants me to extract Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) from the provided 'Prompt Engineering Strategy' artifact. My goal is to identify abstract, reusable actions described in this strategy that can be applied across different domains. I need to go through the strategy document and pull out the core activities, then map them to the TAS schema. The strategy itself describes phases and principles of prompt engineering, which can be translated into general steps for guiding development processes.",
  "output": "The prompt engineering strategy outlines a structured approach to guiding AI agents in developing the Python script. This structure itself can be broken down into task-agnostic steps. The strategy emphasizes principles like clarity, context, actionability, modularity, and iteration. It also defines prompt templates and applies them across different development phases (Design, Implementation, Testing, Documentation). By abstracting these elements, we can identify reusable TAS relevant to managing complex development workflows, especially those involving AI agents.",
