# Research Notes: Python Self-Loading and Service Management

## Self-Loading Scripts

*   **`importlib`:**
    *   `importlib.import_module(name)`: Dynamically imports a module.
    *   `importlib.reload(module)`: Reloads an existing module.
    *   Useful for loading Python code at runtime, enabling dynamic script behavior or updates.
*   **`exec()` and `eval()`:**
    *   Execute Python code from strings.
    *   Generally discouraged due to security and maintainability issues.
*   **`sys.executable` and `os.exec*`:**
    *   Replace the current process with a new one (e.g., re-running the same script).
    *   A direct method for self-respawning.

## Service Management

*   **`subprocess` module:**
    *   `subprocess.run()`: Execute commands and wait.
    *   `subprocess.Popen()`: Execute commands asynchronously, manage I/O.
    *   Essential for interacting with external processes.
*   **`systemd`:**
    *   Linux-native system and service manager.
    *   Manages services (including Python scripts) for startup, restart, logging.
    *   Robust, OS-level solution.
*   **`supervisor`:**
    *   Process control system.
    *   Monitors and controls multiple processes (Python apps).
    *   Ensures services stay running.
    *   Popular for Python applications.
*   **`multiprocessing` module:**
    *   Manages multiple Python processes within a single application.
    *   Can be used to spawn and manage child Python processes that can be designed to restart.
*   **`psutil`:**
    *   Cross-platform library for process and system information.
    *   Can check if a process is running and potentially trigger restarts.

## Key Considerations:

*   **Security:** Dynamic code loading requires careful validation and sandboxing.
*   **Platform Dependency:** `systemd` is Linux-specific. `supervisor` is more portable.
*   **Complexity:** Managing inter-process communication and state can be challenging.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and logging are critical for self-healing scripts.
