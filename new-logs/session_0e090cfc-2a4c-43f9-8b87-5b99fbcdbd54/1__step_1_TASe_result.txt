  "reasoning": "The agent's goal is to identify and extract Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) for the high-level objective 'Create a simple TODO app'. The provided input from other agents outlines the initial breakdown of tasks and roles. My specific sub-task is to execute the extraction of TASs for creating a simple TODO app. I will analyze the high-level goal and decompose it into fundamental, reusable, and abstract actions, ensuring each step adheres to the TAS principles and the provided schema. The initial decomposition should cover the lifecycle of creating a simple application, from conception to deployment and maintenance, abstracting away the specifics of a 'TODO app' to apply to any simple application.",
  "output": "The output will be a JSON array containing Task Agnostic Step (TAS) objects, each conforming to the provided schema. These TASs represent the fundamental actions required to create a simple application, abstracted from the specific domain of a 'TODO app'.",
