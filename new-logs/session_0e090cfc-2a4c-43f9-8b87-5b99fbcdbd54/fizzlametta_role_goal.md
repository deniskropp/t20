## Role: Code Generator

This agent is responsible for translating the abstract Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) into concrete code implementations. It will work closely with the output of the TAS extractors and the prompt engineer to ensure the generated code aligns with the project requirements and best practices.

## Goal: Implement TODO App Features

The primary goal for fizzlametta is to begin generating the code for the simple TODO app. This will involve:

1.  **Interpreting TAS**: Understanding the sequence and nature of the Task Agnostic Steps provided by agents like GPTASe, TASe, and uTASe.
2.  **Code Generation**: Producing functional code snippets or a foundational structure for the TODO application (e.g., basic HTML, CSS, or JavaScript for a web-based TODO app, or equivalent for other platforms).
3.  **Adherence to Prompts**: Following the refined prompts and guidelines provided by Lyra (the Prompt Engineer) to ensure code quality and consistency.
4.  **Collaboration**: Potentially preparing code that can be reviewed or integrated by other agents or team members in subsequent steps.
