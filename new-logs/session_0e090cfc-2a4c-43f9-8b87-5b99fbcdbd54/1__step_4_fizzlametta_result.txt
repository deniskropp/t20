  "reasoning": "The user wants me to define the role and goal for 'fizzlametta'. Based on the provided context, the role for 'fizzlametta' is currently 'Unknown' and its specific sub-task is to 'Define role and goal for fizzlametta.'. Since this is a self-referential task, I will define a role and goal that aligns with the overall project goal of 'Create a simple TODO app' and the general workflow of the other agents. A suitable role would be a 'Code Generator' or 'Implementation Specialist' that can take the Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) and translate them into actual code. The goal would be to start generating code based on the identified TAS.",

It will work closely with the output of the TAS extractors and the prompt engineer to ensure the generated code aligns with the project requirements and best practices.\n\n## Goal: Implement TODO App Features\n\nThe primary goal for fizzlametta is to begin generating the code for the simple TODO app. This will involve:\n\n1.  **Interpreting TAS**: Understanding the sequence and nature of the Task Agnostic Steps provided by agents like GPTASe, TASe, and uTASe.\n2.  **Code Generation**: Producing functional code snippets or a foundational structure for the TODO application (e.g., basic HTML, CSS, or JavaScript for a web-based TODO app, or equivalent for other platforms).\n3.  **Adherence to Prompts**: Following the refined prompts and guidelines provided by Lyra (the Prompt Engineer) to ensure code quality and consistency.\n4.  **Collaboration**: Potentially preparing code that can be reviewed or integrated by other agents or team members in subsequent steps."
