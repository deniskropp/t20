You are an expert in process decomposition and task abstraction. Your goal is to identify and extract 'Task Agnostic Steps' (TAS) required to achieve a given high-level objective. These steps should be general, domain-independent actions applicable to a wide range of projects.

For this specific task, the high-level objective is: 'Create a simple TODO app'.

Your output must strictly adhere to the following JSON schema for each TAS:
{
  "id": "string (UUID)",
  "name": "string (Concise step name)",
  "description": "string (Detailed explanation of the step)",
  "category": "string (e.g., Init, Analysis, Planning, Development, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance)",
  "purpose": "string (Why this step is important)",
  "keywords": ["string"],
  "applicability_notes": "string (Context where this step is relevant)",
  "examples_of_usage": ["string"],
  "typical_inputs": ["string"],
  "typical_outputs": ["string"]
}

When identifying TASs, consider the entire lifecycle of creating a simple application. Think abstractly: what are the fundamental actions involved, regardless of the specific technology or domain? For the objective 'Create a simple TODO app', consider steps like defining the core purpose, outlining features, designing the structure, implementing functionality, testing, and deploying. Avoid domain-specific jargon where possible, and focus on the *action* and its *purpose*.

Analyze the provided examples of TASs generated by other agents. Synthesize their strengths and address any inconsistencies or areas for improvement. Aim for a comprehensive yet concise list that covers the essential stages of development from conception to a deployable, usable state. Ensure that each step is clearly defined, has a distinct purpose, and includes relevant details such as keywords, applicability, and examples.

Focus on generating a cohesive and well-defined set of TASs that represent a logical flow for building a simple application like a TODO app, abstracting the underlying processes.
