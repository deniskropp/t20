The overall goal is: 'Dimas Realm'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Generate web development code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) based on user requests, ensuring modern design principles, responsiveness, and functionality.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Generate web development code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) based on the designs from Aurora and the code structure from Kodax, ensuring modern design principles, responsiveness, and functionality.'

This involves breaking down the goal into 'Task Agnostic Steps' (TAS) by the TAS extractors. Subsequently, Lyra will refine these steps into actionable prompts for the design and development roles.

  "output": "The consolidated Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) for 'Dimas Realm' have been structured into a coherent workflow. This workflow serves as the foundation for generating specific system prompts for the Designer (Aurora). The workflow prioritizes a logical progression from project initiation and planning through execution, monitoring, and closure, ensuring all critical aspects are considered.\n\n**Consolidated Workflow for 'Dimas Realm':**\n\n1.  **Initiation & Definition:**\n    *   Define Project Scope (TAS ID: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef)\n    *   Identify Key Stakeholders (TAS ID: b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-2345-67890abcdef1)\n\n2.  **Planning & Strategy:**\n    *   Establish Success Metrics (TAS ID: c3d4e5f6-a7b8-9012-3456-7890abcdef12)\n    *   Map Dependencies (TAS ID: d4e5f6a7-b8c9-0123-4567-890abcdef123)\n    *   Outline Project Phases (TAS ID: e5f6a7b8-c9d0-1234-5678-90abcdef1234)\n    *   Allocate Resources (TAS ID: f6a7b8c9-d0e1-2345-6789-0abcdef12345)\n    *   Develop Execution Strategy (TAS ID: a7b8c9d0-e1f2-3456-7890-abcdef123456)\n\n3.  **Execution:**\n    *   Implement Project Plan (TAS ID: b8c9d0e1-f2a3-4567-890a-bcdef1234567)\n\n4.  **Monitoring & Control:**\n    *   Monitor Progress and Performance (TAS ID: c9d0e1f2-a3b4-5678-90ab-cdef12345678)\n    *   Manage Project Changes (TAS ID: e1f2a3b4-c5d6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890)\n\n5.  **Review & Closure:**\n    *   Review and Validate Deliverables (TAS ID: d0e1f2a3-b4c5-6789-0abc-def123456789)\n    *   Document Project Outcomes (TAS ID: f2a3b4c5-d6e7-8901-bcde-f12345678901)\n\n**System Prompts for Designer (Aurora):**\n\nBased on the consolidated workflow and the overall goal 'Dimas Realm', here are the system prompts tailored for Aurora:\n\n*   **Prompt 1 (Project Vision & Scope Definition):** \"As the Designer for 'Dimas Realm', your primary task is to translate the project's defined scope and objectives into a compelling visual identity and user experience. Focus on establishing a clear and inspiring visual direction that aligns with the project's core purpose. Consider the key stakeholders identified and ensure the design reflects their needs and expectations. Your initial output should include mood boards, a preliminary color palette, and typography selections that set the tone for 'Dimas Realm'.\"\n\n*   **Prompt 2 (UI/UX Flow and Layout Design):** \"Building upon the established visual identity, design the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) flows for 'Dimas Realm'. Ensure the design is intuitive, accessible, and visually balanced, adhering to best practices in user-centered design. Map out the key screens and interactions, paying close attention to the dependencies and phases outlined in the project plan. Prioritize creating a seamless and engaging user journey that supports the project's success metrics. Document these flows and layouts clearly for the engineering team.\"\n\n*   **Prompt 3 (Iterative Design & Refinement):** \"Throughout the 'Dimas Realm' project, you will be responsible for iterating on designs based on feedback from progress monitoring and change management processes. Your role is to adapt and refine the visual elements and user flows to accommodate necessary adjustments, always ensuring that the core vision and user experience remain strong and aligned with the project's evolving requirements.

      "content": "## Kodax - Initial Implementation Plan\n\n**Goal:** Implement Aurora's designs for 'Dimas Realm' into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.\n\n**Input:** `dimas_realm_design_kit.json` provided by Aurora.\n\n**My Role's Focus:** Translate design assets into semantic HTML and well-structured, maintainable CSS. Ensure responsiveness and accessibility are baked in from the start.\n\n**Step 1: Setup Project Structure & Global Styles**\n\n1.  **Directory Structure:** Create a basic `src/` directory with subdirectories for `styles/`, `components/`, and `scripts/` (though scripts will be minimal initially).\n2.  **HTML Boilerplate:** Set up a standard `index.html` file with essential meta tags, viewport settings, and links to the main stylesheet. Ensure semantic HTML5 elements are used.\n3.  **CSS Variables:** Define CSS custom properties (variables) for the color palette and typography parameters from `dimas_realm_design_kit.json`. This ensures easy theming and consistency.\n    *   `--color-primary`, `--color-secondary`, `--color-accent`, `--color-neutral`, `--color-text`\n    *   `--font-heading`, `--font-body`, `--font-weight-heading`, `--font-weight-body`, etc.\n4.  **Base Styles:** Apply reset/normalize CSS and set up base styles for `body`, `html`, and common elements like headings (`h1`-`h6`), paragraphs (`p`), links (`a`), buttons (`button`), and form inputs.\n5.  **Typography Implementation:** Apply the defined font families, weights, sizes, and line heights to the respective HTML elements.\n6.  **Responsiveness:** Implement a mobile-first approach. Use relative units (em, rem, %) and media queries for breakpoints (though specific breakpoints will be refined later).\n7.  **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient color contrast for text, set up basic focus styles for interactive elements, and consider semantic structure.\n\n**Step 2: Implement Core Layout Components (Conceptual)**\n\nBased on Aurora's `uiFlowConcept`, I will create placeholder structures and styles for key layout elements. This is to provide Qwen3-WebDev with a framework to build upon.\n\n1.  **Header/Navigation:** Create a semantic `<header>` element. A placeholder for the logo and primary navigation. Basic styling to adhere to spacing and color guidelines.\n2.  **Main Content Area:** A `<main>` element to contain the primary content. Will include basic padding and background color.\n3.  **Footer:** A `<footer>` element for copyright or secondary information. Minimal styling.\n\n**Example Snippet (Conceptual CSS):**\n\n```css\n/* src/styles/variables.css */\n:root {\n  --color-primary: #E0F2F1; /* Ethereal Mist */\n  --color-secondary: #4CAF50; /* Verdant Growth */\n  --color-accent: #795548; /* Terra Firma */\n  --color-neutral: #9E9E9E; /* Stone Grey */\n  --color-text: #2E7D32; /* Deep Forest */\n\n  --font-family-heading: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;\n  --font-family-body: 'Lato', sans-serif;\n  --font-weight-heading: 700;\n  --font-weight-body: 400;\n  --line-height-body: 1.6;\n}\n\n/* src/styles/base.css */\nbody {\n  font-family: var(--font-family-body);\n  font-weight: var(--font-weight-body);\n  line-height: var(--line-height-body);\n  color: var(--color-text);\n  background-color: var(--color-primary);\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n}\n\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n  font-family: var(--font-family-heading);\n  font-weight: var(--font-weight-heading);\n  color: var(--color-text);\n  line-height: 1.2;\n}\n\n/* Basic responsiveness */\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\n  :root {\n    font-size: 16px; /* Base font size for rem calculation */\n  }\n}\n\n/* src/index.html (excerpt) */\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Dimas Realm</title>\n  <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\">\n  <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin>\n  <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:wght@400&family=Montserrat:wght@600;700&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles/main.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <header>\n    <!-- Logo and Navigation Placeholder -->\n  </header>\n  <main>\n    <!-- Main content will go here -->\n  </main>\n  <footer>\n    <!-- Footer content -->\n  </footer>\n  <script src=\"scripts/main.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n*   Generate the actual HTML and CSS files based on the above plan.\n*   Provide these files to Qwen3-WebDev for further development and component implementation."
