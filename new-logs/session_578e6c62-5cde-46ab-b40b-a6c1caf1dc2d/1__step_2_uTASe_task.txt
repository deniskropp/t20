The overall goal is: 'Dimas Realm'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and return each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Identify and extract Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) for 'Dimas Realm'.'

The team's roles are:

This involves breaking down the goal into 'Task Agnostic Steps' (TAS) by the TAS extractors. Subsequently, Lyra will refine these steps into actionable prompts for the design and development roles. Aurora will then design the elements, Kodax and Qwen3-WebDev will implement them, and finally, the Deliverable Integrator will bring everything together.
