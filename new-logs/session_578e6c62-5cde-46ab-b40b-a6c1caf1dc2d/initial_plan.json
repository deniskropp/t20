    "reasoning": "The plan is structured to first identify the core components and steps required to achieve the high-level goal 'Dimas Realm'. This involves breaking down the goal into 'Task Agnostic Steps' (TAS) by the TAS extractors. Subsequently, Lyra will refine these steps into actionable prompts for the design and development roles. Aurora will then design the elements, Kodax and Qwen3-WebDev will implement them, and finally, the Deliverable Integrator will bring everything together. This iterative approach ensures that each stage builds upon the previous one, fostering collaboration and alignment towards the ultimate goal.",
