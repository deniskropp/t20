  "reasoning": "The user wants to identify and extract Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) for the high-level goal 'Create a simple TODO app'. I need to break down this goal into fundamental, reusable, and abstract actions, ensuring each step adheres to the TAS principles and the provided JSON schema. I will focus on the core actions involved in software development and feature creation, abstracting away any domain-specific details of a 'TODO app' itself to make the steps applicable to a wider range of projects.",
