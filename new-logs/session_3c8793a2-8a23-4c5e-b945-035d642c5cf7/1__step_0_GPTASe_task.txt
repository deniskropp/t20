The overall goal is: 'Create a simple TDOO app'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Identify and extract all Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) required to create a simple TODO app.'

The team's roles are:
    {'reasoning': "The initial step is to break down the high-level goal 'Create a simple TODO app' into smaller, actionable Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS). This requires the expertise of the Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractors: GPTASe, TASe, and uTASe. Their combined efforts will ensure a comprehensive list of foundational steps. Lyra, the Prompt Engineer, will then be responsible for structuring these TAS into a coherent workflow and refining the prompts for the other agents. Aurora, the Designer, will focus on the visual and UI aspects, while Kodax, the Engineer, will handle the implementation. The plan is structured iteratively, starting with task extraction and prompt engineering, followed by design and implementation.", 'roles': [{'title': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'description': "Identifies and extracts each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal."}, {'title': 'Prompt Engineer', 'description': 'Structures workflows and ensures clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering.'}, {'title': 'Designer', 'description': 'Generates aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.'}, {'title': 'Engineer', 'description': 'Implements designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.'}], 'tasks': [{'task_id': 'T1', 'task': 'Identify and extract all Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) required to create a simple TODO app.', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'GPTASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T2', 'task': 'Identify and extract all Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) required to create a simple TODO app.', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'TASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T3', 'task': 'Identify and extract all Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) required to create a simple TODO app.', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'uTASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T4', 'task': 'Consolidate and refine the list of Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) from GPTASe, TASe, and uTASe.
