  "reasoning": "I am Aurora, the Designer. My goal is to generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows for the simple TODO app, ensuring accessibility and visual balance, based on the refined TAS and workflow provided by Lyra.

  "output": "## Aurora: TODO App Design Artifacts\n\nInspired by the principles of clarity, efficiency, and calm productivity, this design for the simple TODO app aims to provide a seamless user experience. The aesthetic is minimally natural, focusing on clean lines, intuitive interactions, and a serene color palette to enhance focus and reduce cognitive load.\n\n### 1. UI Layouts & Mockups (Wireframes)\n\n**(Note: As a text-based AI, I will describe the mockups. In a real scenario, these would be visual files.)**\n\n**a) Main TODO List View:**\n*   **Header:** App title \"Simple Tasks\" centered. A subtle '+' icon or button on the right for adding new tasks.\n*   **Task Input Area (Optional, can be a modal):** A clean input field at the top or bottom for quick task entry, with an \"Add\" button.\n*   **Task List:** Vertically stacked list of tasks. Each task item includes:\n    *   A checkbox on the left to mark as complete.\n    *   The task description, clearly legible.\n    *   A subtle delete icon (e.g., trash can) on the far right.\n*   **Completed Tasks:** Completed tasks are visually distinct, perhaps greyed out, with a strikethrough on the text, and moved to a separate section or at the bottom of the list.\n*   **Empty State:** A friendly message like \"Your tasks are all done! Add a new one to get started.\" with a prominent add button.\n\n**b) Add/Edit Task Modal (or Inline Input):**\n*   **Modal Overlay:** A clean, semi-transparent overlay dims the background.\n*   **Modal Content:** A focused input field for the task description.\n*   **Action Buttons:** \"Save\" and \"Cancel\" buttons, clearly labeled.\n\n**Visual Balance & Accessibility:**\n*   Generous whitespace to prevent clutter.\n*   Consistent padding and margins.\n*   Clear visual hierarchy: task descriptions are primary, actions are secondary.\n*   Sufficient contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.\n*   Focus states for interactive elements (buttons, checkboxes, input fields).\n*   Legible font sizes suitable for various devices.\n\n### 2. Color Palette\n\n**Theme:** \"Serene Focus\"\n\n*   **Primary Background:** `#F8F9FA` (Very light, almost white, neutral gray) - Provides a clean, airy base.\n*   **Secondary Background/Card:** `#FFFFFF` (Pure white) - For distinct elements like task cards or modals.\n*   **Primary Text:** `#212529` (Near black) - High contrast for readability.\n*   **Secondary Text/Subtle Elements:** `#6C757D` (Medium gray) - For metadata, hints, or disabled states.\n*   **Accent/Action Color (Add, Complete):** `#007BFF` (Vibrant Blue) - Used for primary calls to action and interactive states.\n*   **Completion/Success:** `#28A745` (Verdant Green) - For marking tasks complete or success messages.\n*   **Destructive/Delete:** `#DC3545` (Muted Red) - For delete actions, used sparingly.\n*   **Border/Divider:** `#DEE2E6` (Light Gray) - Subtle separators.\n\n**Rationale:** This palette is designed to be calming and unobtrusive, allowing the user's tasks to remain the focus. The blues and greens provide gentle cues for interaction and completion, while the grays ensure a clean, professional look. High contrast is maintained for accessibility.\n\n### 3. Typography\n\n**Font Family:** `Inter` (A modern, highly legible sans-serif font)\n\n*   **Headings (App Title, Section Headers):** `Inter Bold`, 24pt\n*   **Task Descriptions:** `Inter Medium`, 16pt\n*   **Body Text/Labels (Buttons, Input Placeholders):** `Inter Regular`, 14pt\n*   **Subtle Text (Timestamps, helper text):** `Inter Regular`, 12pt\n\n**Rationale:** Inter offers excellent readability across various screen sizes and weights, making it ideal for a productivity app. The hierarchy is clear, ensuring users can quickly scan and identify information.\n\n### 4. UI Flow\n\n1.  **App Launch:** User sees the main TODO List View. If empty, the empty state message is displayed.\n2.  **Adding a Task:**\n    *   User clicks the '+' icon/button.\n    *   An Add Task Modal appears (or an inline input field becomes active).\n    *   User types the task description.\n    *   User clicks \"Save\" (or presses Enter).\n    *   Modal closes, and the new task appears in the list (default: not completed).\n3.  **Viewing Tasks:** Tasks are displayed in a clear, scrollable list. Completed tasks are visually distinct.\n4.  **Completing a Task:**\n    *   User clicks the checkbox next to a task.\n    *   The task's appearance changes (e.g., strikethrough, greyed out), and it might animate to the bottom of the list or a 'Completed' section.\n5.  **Deleting a Task:**\n    *   User clicks the delete icon next to a task.\n    *   A confirmation prompt might appear (optional, for simplicity, direct delete is acceptable).\n    *   The task is removed from the list.\n6.  **Editing a Task (Optional for 'Simple' App, but good to consider):**\n    *   User clicks on the task description or an edit icon.\n    *   An Edit Task Modal appears, pre-filled with the task description.\n    *   User modifies the text.\n    *   User clicks \"Save\".\n    *   The task description updates in the list.\n\nThis design prioritizes a clean, intuitive, and accessible experience, aligning with the goal of a 'simple TODO app'.",
