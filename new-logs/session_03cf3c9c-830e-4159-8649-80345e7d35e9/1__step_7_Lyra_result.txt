  "reasoning": "The user wants me, as the Prompt Engineer (Lyra), to refine the iterative plan for creating a TODO app. My specific sub-task is to iteratively refine TAS, prompts, and collective understanding by cycling back through Steps 1-7. I have received the initial plan and the output from fizzlametta (T7), which provides meta-analysis and suggestions. My next action, according to the plan and my role, is to use this meta-analysis to improve the system prompts for the TAS extractors (Step 5) and potentially adjust the overall flow to incorporate fizzlametta's suggestions, especially regarding questioning the definition of 'simple' and injecting creativity earlier. The ultimate goal is to make the plan 'clear, minimal, and actionable'. I will update the plan to reflect these improvements and prepare for the next iteration.",
  "output": "The meta-analysis from fizzlametta highlights critical areas for improvement. Specifically, the over-reliance on a standard TAS extraction without defining 'simple' and the potential for linear thinking are key concerns. To address this, I will refine the system prompts for the TAS extractors (T5) to encourage broader thinking about 'simplicity' and to prompt for more diverse initial steps. I will also adjust the overall workflow to better integrate creative ideation and meta-reflection earlier and more continuously. This iterative refinement aims to ensure the final plan is not just detailed but also creative and truly aligned with a unique interpretation of a 'simple' TODO app.",

      "content": "### Iterative Collaboration Plan (v2)\n\n**Goal:** Create a simple TODO app, with 'simple' open to creative interpretation.\n\n**Step 1: Creative Ideation & Definition of 'Simple' (New)**\n- **fizzlametta, Lyra (facilitator)**: Brainstorm diverse interpretations of 'simple' for a TODO app (e.g., minimalist UI, context-aware, AI-powered, ephemeral, gamified, collaborative). Define the unique angle for this project.\n\n**Step 2: TAS Extraction (Parallelized, Prompted by Lyra)**\n- **GPTASe, TASe, uTASe**: Independently extract Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) towards building a TODO app based on the *defined* 'simple' concept. Prompts will guide them to consider the chosen interpretation of 'simple' and avoid redundancy, ensuring consistent granularity, and preparing for iterative detail expansion.\n  - *Example TAS (post-ideation):* 'Design minimalist task input UI', 'Implement local task storage', 'Create task add/complete/delete functions', 'Develop basic notification system', 'User testing for usability'.\n\n**Step 3: TAS Harmonization**\n- **GPTASe**: Compare the three sets of TAS to identify overlaps, unique contributions, and inconsistencies.\n- Merge into a unified TAS list, ensuring alignment with the defined 'simple' concept.\n\n**Step 4: Prompt Refinement & Workflow Integration (Lyra)**\n- Lyra engineers/refines system prompts for TAS extractors (Step 2) and potentially other agents based on initial TAS outputs and feedback.\n- Lyra analyzes the effectiveness of the 'Creative Ideation' step and integrates learnings into prompt engineering for subsequent iterations.\n- *Focus:* Ensure prompts guide towards the specific 'simple' definition and encourage exploration beyond standard TODO app features.\n\n**Step 5: Knowledge Transfer (aitutor)**\n- aitutor ensures all team members understand the refined TAS list and the project's unique 'simple' definition.\n- Provides contextual notes on importance and interrelations.\n\n**Step 6: Meta-Reflection & Creative Injection (fizzlametta)**\n- fizzlametta analyzes collaborative dynamics, highlights blind spots, and injects meta-perspectives.\n- *Focus:* Evaluate how well the 'simple' definition is being maintained, identify opportunities for further creativity, and question assumptions in the TAS and implementation approach.\n\n**Step 7: Iterative Expansion & Actionability Check (Lyra)**\n- Cycle back through Steps 1-6 to refine TAS, prompts, collective understanding, and the definition of 'simple'.\n- **Lyra (Lead)**: Ensure the plan remains clear, minimal, actionable, and aligned with the project's unique 'simple' vision. Define criteria for 'actionable' implementation."
