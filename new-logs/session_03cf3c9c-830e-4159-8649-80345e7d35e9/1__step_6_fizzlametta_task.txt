Avoid redundancy in TAS outputs.\n  2. Ensure TAS granularity is consistent (not too broad or too detailed).\n  3.

  "reasoning": "The user wants to create a JSON representation of an iterative plan for developing a simple TODO app. My role is 'AI Tutor', and my specific goal is 'Knowledge transfer between spaces (agents, ...)', with the sub-task 'Ensure all team members understand the refined TAS list, providing contextual notes on importance and interrelations.' I have received the output from the Prompt Engineer (Lyra) which includes a refined prompt for the TAS extractors. My next step is to facilitate the understanding of this refined TAS list and its importance to the team members, as per my role and sub-task. This involves explaining *why* the refined TAS list is important and *how* the steps interrelate, especially in the context of the iterative process defined in the Iterative Collaboration Plan. I will start by confirming my understanding of the task and then outline how I will proceed.",
  "output": "I understand my sub-task is to ensure all team members comprehend the refined TAS list generated after the prompt engineering step. I will explain the importance of these refined TAS and their interrelations to foster a shared understanding within the team. My approach will involve: \n1. Acknowledging the refined TAS list (which will be generated in the next iteration by the TAS extractors based on Lyra's prompt).\n2. Explaining the significance of having a detailed and consistent TAS list for guiding development.\n3. Highlighting how the interrelations between these TAS are crucial for a smooth workflow and for identifying potential conflicts or dependencies early on.\n4. Emphasizing how this detailed understanding supports the iterative refinement process outlined in the collaboration plan.\n\nSince the refined TAS list itself is not yet generated (that's the output of the TAS extractors *after* Lyra's prompt), my current output is to confirm my understanding of the task and my plan to execute it in the subsequent iteration.

My role is to facilitate the team's comprehension of this refined list.\n\n**My Approach:**\n\n1.  **Confirmation of Refined TAS:** Once the TAS extractors (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe) produce the detailed TAS based on Lyra's prompt, I will begin by acknowledging receipt and reviewing this output.\n2.  **Importance of Refined TAS:** I will explain *why* having a detailed, consistent, and non-redundant TAS list is critical for the success of our project. This includes:\n    *   **Clarity:** Providing a clear roadmap for development.\n    *   **Efficiency:** Reducing ambiguity and preventing wasted effort.\n    *   **Foundation for Iteration:** Serving as a stable base for subsequent refinement and expansion.\n    *   **Alignment:** Ensuring all team members are working towards the same granular objectives.\n3.  **Interrelations and Dependencies:** I will map out and explain the key interrelations between the refined TAS. This will involve:\n    *   Identifying direct dependencies (e.g., 'Implement data storage' must precede 'Develop task CRUD functions').\n    *   Highlighting logical groupings or phases of work.\n    *   Explaining how understanding these connections helps in planning and execution, and how it informs the meta-reflection step (fizzlametta).\n4.  **Facilitating Understanding:** I will use guiding questions and provide examples to ensure each team member grasps the details and their significance. I will encourage questions and discussions.\n5.  **Transition to Next Steps:** After confirming understanding, I will guide the team towards the next phase, which involves meta-reflection (fizzlametta) and iterative expansion.\n\n**Next Action:** I will now prompt the TAS extractors (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe) to generate their detailed TAS based on Lyra's refined prompt (from T5)."
