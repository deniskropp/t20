The JSON should outline the reasoning, roles, and ordered tasks, including dependencies, based on the provided markdown file and team member descriptions. The plan starts with parallelized Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extraction, followed by harmonization, prompt refinement, knowledge transfer, meta-reflection, and an iterative expansion cycle. Each task needs to be assigned to the correct role and team member, with dependencies clearly defined.",
