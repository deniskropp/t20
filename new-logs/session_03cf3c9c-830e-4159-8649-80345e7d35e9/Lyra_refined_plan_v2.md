### Iterative Collaboration Plan (v2)

**Goal:** Create a simple TODO app, with 'simple' open to creative interpretation.

**Step 1: Creative Ideation & Definition of 'Simple' (New)**
- **fizzlametta, Lyra (facilitator)**: Brainstorm diverse interpretations of 'simple' for a TODO app (e.g., minimalist UI, context-aware, AI-powered, ephemeral, gamified, collaborative). Define the unique angle for this project.

**Step 2: TAS Extraction (Parallelized, Prompted by Lyra)**
- **GPTASe, TASe, uTASe**: Independently extract Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) towards building a TODO app based on the *defined* 'simple' concept. Prompts will guide them to consider the chosen interpretation of 'simple' and avoid redundancy, ensuring consistent granularity, and preparing for iterative detail expansion.
  - *Example TAS (post-ideation):* 'Design minimalist task input UI', 'Implement local task storage', 'Create task add/complete/delete functions', 'Develop basic notification system', 'User testing for usability'.

**Step 3: TAS Harmonization**
- **GPTASe**: Compare the three sets of TAS to identify overlaps, unique contributions, and inconsistencies.
- Merge into a unified TAS list, ensuring alignment with the defined 'simple' concept.

**Step 4: Prompt Refinement & Workflow Integration (Lyra)**
- Lyra engineers/refines system prompts for TAS extractors (Step 2) and potentially other agents based on initial TAS outputs and feedback.
- Lyra analyzes the effectiveness of the 'Creative Ideation' step and integrates learnings into prompt engineering for subsequent iterations.
- *Focus:* Ensure prompts guide towards the specific 'simple' definition and encourage exploration beyond standard TODO app features.

**Step 5: Knowledge Transfer (aitutor)**
- aitutor ensures all team members understand the refined TAS list and the project's unique 'simple' definition.
- Provides contextual notes on importance and interrelations.

**Step 6: Meta-Reflection & Creative Injection (fizzlametta)**
- fizzlametta analyzes collaborative dynamics, highlights blind spots, and injects meta-perspectives.
- *Focus:* Evaluate how well the 'simple' definition is being maintained, identify opportunities for further creativity, and question assumptions in the TAS and implementation approach.

**Step 7: Iterative Expansion & Actionability Check (Lyra)**
- Cycle back through Steps 1-6 to refine TAS, prompts, collective understanding, and the definition of 'simple'.
- **Lyra (Lead)**: Ensure the plan remains clear, minimal, actionable, and aligned with the project's unique 'simple' vision. Define criteria for 'actionable' implementation.
