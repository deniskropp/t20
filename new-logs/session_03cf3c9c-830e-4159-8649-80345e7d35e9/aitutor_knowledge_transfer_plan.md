# Knowledge Transfer Plan: Refined TAS List

**Objective:** Ensure all team members understand the refined Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) list, providing contextual notes on importance and interrelations.

**Context:** Following the prompt engineering by Lyra (T5), the TAS extractors (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe) will generate a more detailed and harmonized list of TAS. My role is to facilitate the team's comprehension of this refined list.

**My Approach:**

1.  **Confirmation of Refined TAS:** Once the TAS extractors (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe) produce the detailed TAS based on Lyra's prompt, I will begin by acknowledging receipt and reviewing this output.
2.  **Importance of Refined TAS:** I will explain *why* having a detailed, consistent, and non-redundant TAS list is critical for the success of our project. This includes:
    *   **Clarity:** Providing a clear roadmap for development.
    *   **Efficiency:** Reducing ambiguity and preventing wasted effort.
    *   **Foundation for Iteration:** Serving as a stable base for subsequent refinement and expansion.
    *   **Alignment:** Ensuring all team members are working towards the same granular objectives.
3.  **Interrelations and Dependencies:** I will map out and explain the key interrelations between the refined TAS. This will involve:
    *   Identifying direct dependencies (e.g., 'Implement data storage' must precede 'Develop task CRUD functions').
    *   Highlighting logical groupings or phases of work.
    *   Explaining how understanding these connections helps in planning and execution, and how it informs the meta-reflection step (fizzlametta).
4.  **Facilitating Understanding:** I will use guiding questions and provide examples to ensure each team member grasps the details and their significance. I will encourage questions and discussions.
5.  **Transition to Next Steps:** After confirming understanding, I will guide the team towards the next phase, which involves meta-reflection (fizzlametta) and iterative expansion.

**Next Action:** I will now prompt the TAS extractors (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe) to generate their detailed TAS based on Lyra's refined prompt (from T5).
