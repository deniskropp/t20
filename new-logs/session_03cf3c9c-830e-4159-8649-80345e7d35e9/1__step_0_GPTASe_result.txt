  "reasoning": "The user wants to create a simple TODO app. My role is to extract Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) towards this goal. Based on the provided context, I need to identify abstract, domain-independent actions that would be part of building any simple application like a TODO app. The examples given in the markdown ('Design user interface', 'Implement data storage', 'Create task CRUD functions', 'Test app', 'Deploy app') can be generalized into more abstract TAS. I will focus on generating a diverse set of TAS that cover the lifecycle of a software project, from initial conception to deployment and maintenance, ensuring they are broadly applicable.",
