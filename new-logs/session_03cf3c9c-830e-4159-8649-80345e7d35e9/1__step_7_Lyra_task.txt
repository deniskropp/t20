The overall goal is: 'Create a simple TDOO app'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Iteratively refine TAS, prompts, and collective understanding by cycling back through Steps 1-7 until the TODO app plan is clear, minimal, and actionable.'

The team's roles are:

{"files/Iterative Collaboration Plan.md": "### Iterative Collaboration Plan\n\n**Step 1: TAS Extraction (Parallelized)**\n- **GPTASe, TASe, uTASe**: Each independently extracts Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) toward building a simple TODO app.\n  - Example TAS: 'Design user interface', 'Implement data storage', 'Create task CRUD functions', 'Test app', 'Deploy app'.\n\n**Step 2: TAS Harmonization**\n- Compare the three sets of TAS to identify overlaps, unique contributions, and inconsistencies.\n- Merge into a unified TAS list.\n\n**Step 3: Prompt Refinement (Lyra)**\n- Lyra engineers system prompts for each extractor to:\n  1. Avoid redundancy in TAS outputs.\n  2. Ensure TAS granularity is consistent (not too broad or too detailed).\n  3. Guide extractors toward iterative detail expansion.\n\n**Step 4: Knowledge Transfer (aitutor)**\n- aitutor ensures that all team members understand the refined TAS list.\n- Provides contextual notes on why steps are important and how they interrelate.\n\n**Step 5: Meta-Reflection (fizzlametta)**\n- fizzlametta analyzes the collaborative dynamics, highlights blind spots, and injects meta-perspectives (e.g., questioning assumptions, surfacing creativity).\n\n**Step 6: Iterative Expansion**\n- Cycle back through Steps 1\u20135 to refine TAS, prompts, and collective understanding until the TODO app plan is clear, minimal, and actionable."}

  "reasoning": "The user wants to analyze collaborative dynamics, highlight blind spots, and inject meta-perspectives for the TODO app project. My role is 'Unknown', which is described as 'Role with an undefined goal, likely for meta-analysis or creative input.' The previous step (T6) by the AI Tutor focused on knowledge transfer of the refined TAS list. My sub-task (T7) is to perform meta-analysis and inject creativity. This means I need to look at the process so far, identify potential issues or areas for improvement that the other agents might miss, and suggest creative approaches or question underlying assumptions. I will analyze the iterative plan, the roles, and the outputs from previous steps (implicitly, the plan itself and the AI Tutor's output). I will focus on how the current structure might lead to blind spots and offer meta-perspectives to enhance creativity and critical thinking within the team. I will also consider the overall goal of creating a 'simple TODO app' and ensure my meta-analysis contributes to that goal effectively.",
