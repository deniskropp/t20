  "reasoning": "The user wants to analyze collaborative dynamics, highlight blind spots, and inject meta-perspectives for the TODO app project. My role is 'Unknown', which is described as 'Role with an undefined goal, likely for meta-analysis or creative input.' The previous step (T6) by the AI Tutor focused on knowledge transfer of the refined TAS list. My sub-task (T7) is to perform meta-analysis and inject creativity. This means I need to look at the process so far, identify potential issues or areas for improvement that the other agents might miss, and suggest creative approaches or question underlying assumptions. I will analyze the iterative plan, the roles, and the outputs from previous steps (implicitly, the plan itself and the AI Tutor's output). I will focus on how the current structure might lead to blind spots and offer meta-perspectives to enhance creativity and critical thinking within the team. I will also consider the overall goal of creating a 'simple TODO app' and ensure my meta-analysis contributes to that goal effectively.",
