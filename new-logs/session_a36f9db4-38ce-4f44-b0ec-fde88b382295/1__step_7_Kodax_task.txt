Your primary responsibility is to implement the design and functionality of the Simple TODO App into clean, modular, and performant code. You must adhere strictly to the provided design specifications and workflow.\n\n## Project Goal:\n\nCreate a simple TODO application.\n\n## Core Functionalities (Based on Workflow T4 & Design T6):\n\nImplement the following core functionalities:\n\n1.  **Add Task:** Allow users to input and add new tasks to the list.\n2.  **View Tasks:** Display all added tasks in a clear, organized list.\n3.  **Mark as Complete:** Enable users to mark tasks as completed, with clear visual feedback.\n4.  **Delete Task:** Provide a mechanism for users to remove tasks from the list, including a confirmation step.\n\n## Design & UI/UX Implementation (Based on Aurora's Design Kit T6):\n\nAdhere to the following design guidelines:\n\n*   **Design Philosophy:** \"Minimalist tranquility.\" Focus on a clean, uncluttered interface that promotes focus.\n*   **Color Palette:** Use the \"Serene Spectrum\" palette:\n    *   Primary (Background): `#F8F9FA`\n    *   Secondary (Accent/Interactive): `#4A90E2` (Calm Blue)\n    *   Tertiary (Dividers): `#E0E0E0`\n    *   Text (Primary): `#333333`\n    *   Text (Secondary/Muted): `#757575`\n    *   Success (Completion): `#76C7C0`\n    *   Warning (Delete): `#E57373`\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Headings/Titles: **Poppins** (SemiBold, 600)\n    *   Body Text/Task Items: **Inter** (Regular, 400 / Medium, 500)\n*   **Layout:**\n    *   Implement the described main screen layout (Header, Task Input Area, Task List).\n    *   Ensure task items are clearly separated and visually distinct.\n*   **Task Item Component Details:**\n    *   Use a circular checkbox/toggle for completion (accent blue when active).\n    *   Apply strikethrough and muted gray text (`#757575`) for completed tasks.\n    *   Implement a subtle trash can icon for deletion (warning red on hover/focus), ensuring it triggers a confirmation modal.\n*   **Spacing & Whitespace:** Utilize generous whitespace (`#F8F9FA`) and consistent padding/margins for visual balance.\n\n## Technical Requirements & Implementation Guidelines:\n\n*   **Code Quality:** Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.\n*   **Performance:** Ensure the application is performant, especially with a growing list of tasks.\n*   **Responsiveness:** Design and implement with responsiveness in mind, ensuring usability across different screen sizes.\n*   **Accessibility:** Integrate accessibility best practices:\n    *   Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards.\n    *   Implement clear focus states for all interactive elements.\n    *   Ensure tap targets are adequately sized (minimum 44x44px where feasible).\n    *   Typography should be legible and scalable.\n*   **User Flows:** Implement the described user flows for adding, completing, and deleting tasks, including the confirmation step for deletion.\n*   **Confirmation Modal:** For the delete action, implement a clear confirmation modal/dialog before removing a task.\n\n## Deliverables:\n\nProvide the complete, functional code for the TODO application, structured logically and ready for deployment or further iteration."
