Design the core UI components for adding, viewing, completing, and deleting tasks. 5. Outline the primary user flows. 6. Package these elements into a brand kit and layout descriptions.",
  "output": "Aurora's Design Deliverables for the Simple TODO App\n\n**Design Philosophy:**\nOur design for the TODO app embraces 'minimalist tranquility.' The interface is crafted to be a serene space for task management, reducing cognitive load and promoting focus. We prioritize clarity, intuitive interaction, and a visually balanced aesthetic that feels both modern and calming. Accessibility is woven into the fabric of the design, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.\n\n**1. Color Palette: 'Serene Spectrum'**\nThis palette is designed for calm focus and high contrast, ensuring readability and accessibility.\n\n*   **Primary (Background/Base):** `#F8F9FA` (Off-White/Light Gray) - Provides a clean, airy canvas.\n*   **Secondary (Accent/Interactive Elements):** `#4A90E2` (Calm Blue) - Used for buttons, active states, and key interactive elements. Offers good contrast.\n*   **Tertiary (Subtle Highlights/Dividers):** `#E0E0E0` (Light Gray) - For subtle separators and less prominent UI elements.\n*   **Text (Primary):** `#333333` (Dark Gray) - High contrast for main text content.\n*   **Text (Secondary/Muted):** `#757575` (Medium Gray) - For secondary information or disabled states.\n*   **Success/Completion:** `#76C7C0` (Teal Green) - Subtle but clear indicator for completed tasks.\n*   **Delete/Warning:** `#E57373` (Soft Red) - Used sparingly for delete actions, with clear affordance.\n\n**2. Typography: 'Clarity & Flow'**\nA combination of a clean sans-serif for headings and a highly readable sans-serif for body text ensures excellent legibility across all elements.\n\n*   **Headings/Titles:** **Poppins** (SemiBold, 600)\n    *   *Usage:* App Title, Section Headers, Button Labels.\n    *   *Rationale:* Geometric sans-serif with a friendly yet modern feel. Excellent for display.\n*   **Body Text/Task Items:** **Inter** (Regular, 400 / Medium, 500)\n    *   *Usage:* Task descriptions, input fields, helper text.\n    *   *Rationale:* Designed for UI, highly legible at various sizes, provides excellent readability for lists and detailed text.\n\n**3. Logo & Brand Mark:**\n*   **Concept:** A simple, abstract mark representing a checked list item evolving into a gentle wave or checkmark, signifying completion and flow.\n*   **Visual:** A stylized checkmark formed by two smooth, curved lines, creating a sense of gentle motion. The primary color (`#4A90E2`) would be used.\n*   **Wordmark:** 'TODO' in Poppins (SemiBold), potentially with the brand mark subtly integrated or placed to its left.\n\n**4. UI Layouts & Components:**\n\n*   **Main Screen Layout:**\n    *   **Header:** App title ('TODO') centered or left-aligned using Poppins (SemiBold).\n    *   **Task Input Area:** A prominent input field at the top, using Inter (Regular), with a clear placeholder ('Add a new task...'). A distinct 'Add' button (using Calm Blue `#4A90E2` background, white text) sits adjacent or below.\n    *   **Task List:** Vertically scrolling list. Each task item is a distinct card or row with ample padding.\n    *   **Footer (Optional):** Could contain filter/sort options or a summary count.\n\n*   **Task Item Component:**\n    *   **Layout:** Horizontal arrangement within a row.\n    *   **Checkbox/Completion:** A circular checkbox or a toggle switch on the left (using Calm Blue `#4A90E2` when active). Sufficient tap target size.\n    *   **Task Description:** Main text area using Inter (Regular). For completed tasks, apply a strikethrough and use Muted Gray `#757575` text color.\n    *   **Delete Action:** A subtle trash can icon (using Soft Red `#E57373` on hover/focus) aligned to the right. A confirmation modal/snackbar appears upon tap to prevent accidental deletion.\n\n*   **Visual Balance & Spacing:** Generous use of white space (`#F8F9FA` background) around elements. Consistent padding within task items (e.g., 16px) and margins between items (e.g., 8-12px). Focus on alignment and a clean grid structure.\n\n**5. UI Flows:**\n\n*   **Adding a Task:**\n    1.  User taps into the input field.\n    2.  User types task description.\n    3.  User taps 'Add' button.\n    4.  Task animates into the top of the task list.\n    5.  Input field clears, ready for the next task.\n\n*   **Completing a Task:**\n    1.  User taps the checkbox next to a task.\n    2.  Checkbox fills with Calm Blue (`#4A90E2`).\n    3.  Task text gets a strikethrough and text color changes to Muted Gray (`#757575`).\n    4.  (Optional) Task may animate subtly to a 'completed' section or remain in place with visual distinction.\n\n*   **Deleting a Task:**\n    1.  User taps the delete icon next to a task.\n    2.  A confirmation modal appears ('Are you sure you want to delete this task?').\n    3.  User taps 'Confirm' or 'Cancel'.\n    4.  If confirmed, the task animates out of the list.\n\n**Accessibility Notes:**\n*   Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (e.g., Dark Gray text on Off-White background).\n*   Focus states are clearly defined for interactive elements (e.g., outline on buttons, focus on input fields).\n*   Tap targets are sufficiently large (min 44x44px where possible).\n*   Typography is scalable and legible.\n",

      "content": "# TODO App: Aesthetic Layout Descriptions\n\n## Overall Aesthetic: Minimalist Tranquility\n\nThe design embraces a clean, uncluttered aesthetic that promotes focus and calm. We utilize ample white space, soft color transitions, and clear visual hierarchy to create an intuitive and serene user experience.\n\n## 1. Main Screen Layout\n\n*   **Header:** A simple, clean header displaying the app title \"TODO\" prominently. The typography uses Poppins SemiBold, providing a friendly yet authoritative presence. It's either centered or left-aligned for balance.\n*   **Task Input Area:** Positioned directly below the header for immediate access. It features a wide input field with a subtle border and a clear placeholder text like \"Add a new task...\". The text within the input field uses Inter Regular. Adjacent to this is a clearly defined \"Add\" button, styled with the primary accent color (`#4A90E2`) for visual prominence, ensuring it's easily discoverable.\n*   **Task List:** This is the core of the screen. Tasks are presented in a clean, vertical list. Each task occupies its own row with generous padding, ensuring no visual clutter. Subtle dividers (`#E0E0E0`) might be used between tasks for further separation, or tasks might rely solely on spacing.\n\n## 2. Task Item Component\n\n*   **Structure:** Each task is a distinct horizontal element within the list.\n*   **Completion Control:** On the far left, a circular checkbox awaits interaction. It's designed with a generous tap target. When unchecked, it's outlined in a neutral color. When checked (task completed), it fills with the accent blue (`#4A90E2`), and the task description visually updates.\n*   **Task Description:** Occupies the main central area of the task item. Uses the highly legible Inter font. For completed tasks, a distinct strikethrough is applied, and the text color shifts to a muted gray (`#757575`), providing immediate visual feedback.\n*   **Delete Action:** Positioned on the far right, a minimalist trash can icon serves as the delete affordance. This icon uses the warning red (`#E57373`) to signal its function. Interaction with this icon triggers a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletion, ensuring user control.\n\n## 3. User Flow Visualization (Conceptual)\n\n*   **Adding:** Imagine typing into the input field, the text appearing smoothly. Tapping 'Add' causes the new task to elegantly slide into the top position of the list, followed by the input field clearing itself, ready for the next entry.\n*   **Completing:** A satisfying tap on the checkbox. The checkmark fills, the text gains its strikethrough, and the item slightly dims or shifts its visual weight, clearly marking it as done.\n*   **Deleting:** Tapping the trash icon prompts a gentle modal overlay, asking for confirmation. The choice to confirm or cancel is clear, and upon confirmation, the task smoothly animates out of view.\n\n## Accessibility Considerations Integrated:\n\n*   **Contrast:** All text and interactive elements have been checked against WCAG AA standards against the chosen backgrounds.\n*   **Spacing:** Ample spacing prevents visual crowding and aids users with motor impairments.\n*   **Focus Indicators:** Clear visual cues will be present for keyboard navigation and screen reader users on all interactive elements."
