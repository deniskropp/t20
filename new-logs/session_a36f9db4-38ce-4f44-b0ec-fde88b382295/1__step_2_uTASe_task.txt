The overall goal is: 'Create a simple TDOO app'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and return each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Consolidate and refine the list of actionable steps, ensuring they are task-agnostic.'

The team's roles are:
    {'reasoning': 'The high-level goal is to create a simple TODO app. The plan should start by identifying the fundamental steps required, which will be handled by the TAS extractors.

{
  "reasoning": "The user's request is to break down the identified functionalities (add task, view tasks, mark as complete, delete task) into smaller, actionable, and task-agnostic steps. The previous step (T1) provided an initial set of TAS based on these functionalities. My task (T2) is to refine these and potentially add more granular steps if needed to ensure they are truly task-agnostic and follow the TAS principles. I will review the provided TAS from T1 and ensure each is well-defined and then package them into the required JSON format.",
