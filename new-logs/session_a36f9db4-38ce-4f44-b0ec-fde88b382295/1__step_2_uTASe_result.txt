The input I received (from T2) is already a list of TAS. My task now is to review these TAS, ensure they meet the criteria of being task-agnostic, and then present them in the final JSON format as required by the schema. I will use the TAS provided by T2 as the basis and ensure they are well-formed according to the TAS principles and schema.",
