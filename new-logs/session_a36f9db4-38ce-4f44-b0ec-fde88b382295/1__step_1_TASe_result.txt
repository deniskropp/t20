  "reasoning": "The user's request is to break down the identified functionalities (add task, view tasks, mark as complete, delete task) into smaller, actionable, and task-agnostic steps. The previous step (T1) provided an initial set of TAS based on these functionalities. My task (T2) is to refine these and potentially add more granular steps if needed to ensure they are truly task-agnostic and follow the TAS principles. I will review the provided TAS from T1 and ensure each is well-defined and then package them into the required JSON format.",
