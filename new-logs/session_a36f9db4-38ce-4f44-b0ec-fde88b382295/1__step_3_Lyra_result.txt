  "reasoning": "The user wants me to act as 'Lyra', the Prompt Engineer, and execute sub-task T4: 'Structure the extracted TAS into a logical development workflow, defining the order of operations and dependencies.' I have received the consolidated Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) from the previous step (T3). My goal is to organize these TAS into a coherent workflow that represents the development process for a simple TODO app. This involves identifying dependencies and establishing a logical sequence for the tasks. I will then present this workflow in a structured JSON format.",
  "output": "The following workflow structures the development of a simple TODO application based on the provided Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS):\n\n**Phase 1: Foundational Setup & Core Functionality Definition**\n1.  **T1: Identify Core Functionalities:** Define the essential features of a simple TODO app (add, view, complete, delete).\n    *   *Dependencies:* None.\n    *   *Role:* Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor.\n2.  **T2: Break Down Functionalities:** Decompose the core functionalities into smaller, actionable steps.\n    *   *Dependencies:* T1.\n    *   *Role:* Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor.\n3.  **T3: Consolidate and Refine TAS:** Ensure all steps are task-agnostic and well-defined.\n    *   *Dependencies:* T2.\n    *   *Role:* Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor.\n\n**Phase 2: Workflow Structuring & Prompt Engineering**\n4.  **T4: Structure Development Workflow:** Organize the refined TAS into a logical sequence with defined dependencies. (This current task).\n    *   *Dependencies:* T3.\n    *   *Role:* Prompt Engineer.\n    *   *Output:* This structured workflow.\n5.  **T5: Develop Designer System Prompt:** Create a prompt for the Designer agent, outlining UI requirements based on the workflow and core functionalities.\n    *   *Dependencies:* T4.\n    *   *Role:* Prompt Engineer.\n\n**Phase 3: Design & Implementation**\n6.  **T6: Generate UI/UX Design:** Create layouts, color schemes, typography, and UI flows for the TODO app.\n    *   *Dependencies:* T5.\n    *   *Role:* Designer.\n7.  **T7: Develop Engineer System Prompt:** Create a prompt for the Engineer agent, detailing implementation requirements based on the workflow and design outputs.\n    *   *Dependencies:* T4, T6.\n    *   *Role:* Prompt Engineer.\n8.  **T8: Implement Code:** Develop the functional TODO application based on the design and engineer prompts.\n    *   *Dependencies:* T7.\n    *   *Role:* Engineer.\n\n**Mapping TAS to Workflow Steps:**\n*   **Define Data Input Mechanism (TAS ID: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef):** Corresponds to the 'add task' functionality. This will be addressed in T2, T3, T5, T6, and T8.\n*   **Establish Data Display (TAS ID: b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-2345-67890abcdef0):** Corresponds to the 'view tasks' functionality. This will be addressed in T2, T3, T5, T6, and T8.\n*   **Define State Modification (TAS ID: c3d4e5f6-a7b8-9012-3456-7890abcdef01):** Corresponds to the 'mark as complete' functionality.
