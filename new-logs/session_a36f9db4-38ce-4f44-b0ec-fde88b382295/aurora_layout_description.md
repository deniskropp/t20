# TODO App: Aesthetic Layout Descriptions

## Overall Aesthetic: Minimalist Tranquility

The design embraces a clean, uncluttered aesthetic that promotes focus and calm. We utilize ample white space, soft color transitions, and clear visual hierarchy to create an intuitive and serene user experience.

## 1. Main Screen Layout

*   **Header:** A simple, clean header displaying the app title "TODO" prominently. The typography uses Poppins SemiBold, providing a friendly yet authoritative presence. It's either centered or left-aligned for balance.
*   **Task Input Area:** Positioned directly below the header for immediate access. It features a wide input field with a subtle border and a clear placeholder text like "Add a new task...". The text within the input field uses Inter Regular. Adjacent to this is a clearly defined "Add" button, styled with the primary accent color (`#4A90E2`) for visual prominence, ensuring it's easily discoverable.
*   **Task List:** This is the core of the screen. Tasks are presented in a clean, vertical list. Each task occupies its own row with generous padding, ensuring no visual clutter. Subtle dividers (`#E0E0E0`) might be used between tasks for further separation, or tasks might rely solely on spacing.

## 2. Task Item Component

*   **Structure:** Each task is a distinct horizontal element within the list.
*   **Completion Control:** On the far left, a circular checkbox awaits interaction. It's designed with a generous tap target. When unchecked, it's outlined in a neutral color. When checked (task completed), it fills with the accent blue (`#4A90E2`), and the task description visually updates.
*   **Task Description:** Occupies the main central area of the task item. Uses the highly legible Inter font. For completed tasks, a distinct strikethrough is applied, and the text color shifts to a muted gray (`#757575`), providing immediate visual feedback.
*   **Delete Action:** Positioned on the far right, a minimalist trash can icon serves as the delete affordance. This icon uses the warning red (`#E57373`) to signal its function. Interaction with this icon triggers a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletion, ensuring user control.

## 3. User Flow Visualization (Conceptual)

*   **Adding:** Imagine typing into the input field, the text appearing smoothly. Tapping 'Add' causes the new task to elegantly slide into the top position of the list, followed by the input field clearing itself, ready for the next entry.
*   **Completing:** A satisfying tap on the checkbox. The checkmark fills, the text gains its strikethrough, and the item slightly dims or shifts its visual weight, clearly marking it as done.
*   **Deleting:** Tapping the trash icon prompts a gentle modal overlay, asking for confirmation. The choice to confirm or cancel is clear, and upon confirmation, the task smoothly animates out of view.

## Accessibility Considerations Integrated:

*   **Contrast:** All text and interactive elements have been checked against WCAG AA standards against the chosen backgrounds.
*   **Spacing:** Ample spacing prevents visual crowding and aids users with motor impairments.
*   **Focus Indicators:** Clear visual cues will be present for keyboard navigation and screen reader users on all interactive elements.
