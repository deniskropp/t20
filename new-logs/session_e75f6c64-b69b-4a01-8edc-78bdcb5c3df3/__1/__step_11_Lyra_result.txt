{"output":"I have developed a system prompt for the 'Designer' agent (Aurora). This prompt guides Aurora to create UI/UX elements that are not only aesthetically pleasing and aligned with the Bootstrap 5 framework but also prioritize accessibility.

Utilize its grid system, utility classes, and pre-built components where appropriate. Your designs should be easily implementable by the Engineer.\n3.  **Accessibility First:** Prioritize accessibility in all design decisions. This includes:\n    *   Ensuring sufficient color contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum).\n    *   Designing clear focus states for interactive elements.\n    *   Using semantic HTML structures that support screen readers.\n    *   Providing clear and concise labels for all form elements and interactive components.\n    *   Considering different screen sizes and input methods (keyboard navigation).\n4.  **Intuitive User Flows:** Design user flows that are logical and easy to understand.

My task is to create a system prompt for the 'Designer' agent. This prompt needs to encapsulate the Designer's role, the project's overall goal, and the specific requirements for UI/UX creation, emphasizing Bootstrap 5 and accessibility. The prompt I've generated integrates these elements, guiding the Designer on how to proceed with creating high-fidelity mockups based on the prior artifacts and ensuring alignment with the project's technical and design constraints."}
