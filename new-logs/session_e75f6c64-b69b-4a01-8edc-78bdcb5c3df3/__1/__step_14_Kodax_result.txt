This includes updating `package.json` with production-relevant scripts and dependencies, creating a `.env.production` file for environment-specific variables like the API URL, and ensuring `api.js` correctly utilizes these environment variables. This fulfills the sub-task of preparing the frontend for deployment.","prompts":[]},"reasoning":"The sub-task is 'Prepare the frontend application for deployment, including build processes and configuration for a production environment.' To achieve this, I have taken the following steps:\n\n1.  **`frontend/package.json`**: Ensured the `scripts` section includes `\"build\": \"react-scripts build\"`, which is the standard command for creating a production build with Create React App. Also, verified that dependencies are suitable for a production environment. Added linting scripts for better code quality checks before deployment.\n2.  **`frontend/.env.production`**: Created a `.env.production` file. This is the standard way Create React App (and thus `react-scripts`) handles environment-specific variables for production builds. The `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set here, which is crucial for pointing the frontend to the correct backend API in a production deployment.\n3.  **`frontend/src/services/api.js`**: Modified the `apiClient` to use `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` for its base URL. This ensures that when the application is built for production, it will use the API URL defined in `.env.production`, rather than the default development URL.\n\nThese actions directly address the sub-task by configuring the build process (`react-scripts build`) and setting up production-specific configurations (environment variables for API URL) necessary for deployment."}
