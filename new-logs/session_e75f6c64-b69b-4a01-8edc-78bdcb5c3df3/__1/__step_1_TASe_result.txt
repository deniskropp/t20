{"output":"I have analyzed the `main.py` file to identify the core functionalities of the Qdrant Service that need to be exposed to the frontend. The relevant API endpoints for user interaction are:\n\n1.  **Listing Available Models:** The `/models` endpoint, which retrieves a list of supported models (e.g., `ViT-B-32`, `RN50`), is crucial for users to select which model they want to use for searches or benchmarks.\n2.  **Indexing Images:** The `/index_image` endpoint allows users to upload and add new images to the Qdrant index. This involves providing the image data (as base64) and associated metadata.\n3.  **Searching by Text:** The `/benchmark/text` endpoint enables users to perform searches using text queries against the indexed images. This requires a text query and the selection of a model.\n4.  **Searching by Image:** The `/benchmark/image` endpoint allows users to perform searches by uploading an image. This requires the image data (as base64) and the selection of a model.","artifact":null,"team":null,"reasoning":"The user asked to identify core Qdrant Service functionalities relevant for frontend exposure based on `main.py`. My sub-task is to identify API endpoints for user interaction.\n\nI reviewed the `main.py` file and identified the following FastAPI endpoints:\n- `@app.get(\"/models\", response_model=List[ModelInfo])`\n- `@app.post(\"/benchmark/text\", response_model=BenchmarkResponse)`\n- `@app.post(\"/benchmark/image\", response_model=BenchmarkResponse)`\n- `@app.post(\"/index_image\", response_model=Dict[str, str])`\n\nThese endpoints correspond to the following user-facing actions:\n1.  **Listing Models:** Users need to know which models are available for searching or benchmarking. This maps to the `/models` endpoint.\n2.  **Indexing Images:** Users will want to add their own images to the service. This maps to the `/index_image` endpoint.\n3.  **Searching by Text:** A primary use case is searching for images using text descriptions. This maps to the `/benchmark/text` endpoint.\n4.  **Searching by Image:** Another primary use case is searching for similar images using an example image. This maps to the `/benchmark/image` endpoint.\n\nI have summarized these findings in the `output` field, clearly stating the relevant endpoints and the user interactions they facilitate."}
