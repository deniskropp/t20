I have analyzed the `main.py` content and extracted the following TAS:\n\n1.  **Define API Endpoints**: The code clearly defines FastAPI routes (`@app.get`, `@app.post`) which correspond to API endpoints. This TAS is about identifying and documenting these.\n2.  **Analyze Data Structures**: The code uses Pydantic models (`BaseModel`) extensively for request and response schemas, and also interacts with Qdrant's data structures. This TAS covers understanding these.\n3.  **Understand Backend Functionality**: The `QdrantService` class and its methods (`search_by_text`, `index_image`, etc.) represent the core backend functionalities. This TAS is about comprehending these.\n\nThese steps are domain-agnostic as they focus on the abstract concepts of defining interfaces, understanding data, and comprehending logic, which are applicable to any backend service, not just Qdrant or Python specific implementations. The output is structured as a JSON array of TAS objects, adhering to the provided schema."}
