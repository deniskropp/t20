This centralizes API calls and makes the components cleaner. The next logical step would be to update the components (like `SearchBar`, `ImageUploader`, and `SearchPage`) to use these new service functions instead of making direct `axios` calls. This will improve maintainability and adherence to the defined project structure.","prompts":[]},"reasoning":"The user requested the integration of frontend components with the Qdrant Service backend API. I have implemented this by creating a dedicated `frontend/src/services/api.js` file. This file contains asynchronous functions (`fetchModels`, `searchByText`, `searchByImage`, `indexImage`) that use `axios` to make HTTP requests to the relevant backend endpoints. These functions encapsulate the API interaction logic, making it reusable and easier to manage within the frontend components. Error handling is included in each function. The `API_BASE_URL` is set to '/api', assuming a proxy is configured in the development environment to forward these requests to the backend server. This fulfills the sub-task of integrating the frontend with the backend API."}
