  "reasoning": "The user wants to create a simple TODO app. As the Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) Extractor, my goal is to break down this high-level objective into fundamental, reusable, and abstract actions. I will identify the core steps involved in software development and app creation, stripping away domain-specific details of a 'TODO app' to focus on the general process. This involves identifying steps like defining requirements, designing the architecture, developing features, testing, and deployment, all expressed in a task-agnostic manner.",
