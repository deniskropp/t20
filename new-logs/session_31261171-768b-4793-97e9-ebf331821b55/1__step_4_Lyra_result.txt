  "reasoning": "The user wants me, as the Prompt Engineer (Lyra), to refine system prompts for the TAS extractors. My goal is to ensure clarity, avoid redundancy, and guide iterative detail expansion. I will analyze the unified TAS list provided by GPTASe (T4) and craft prompts that address these points. The prompts should encourage the TAS extractors to generate steps with consistent granularity and to progressively add more detail in subsequent iterations, while also avoiding overlapping or redundant steps. I will focus on the 'Prompt Refinement' step (T5) of the overall plan.",

These prompts aim to guide them in avoiding redundancy, maintaining consistent granularity, and facilitating iterative detail expansion.
