Avoid redundancy in TAS outputs.\n  2. Ensure TAS granularity is consistent (not too broad or too detailed).\n  3.

  "reasoning": "The user wants me to act as the AI Tutor and ensure all team members understand the refined TAS list, providing contextual notes on step importance and interrelations. This is Task 6 in the provided plan. I have received the output from the Prompt Engineer (Lyra) which includes refined prompts for the TAS extractors. My task is to facilitate knowledge transfer about the *refined TAS list*. Since the prompt engineer's output focuses on *prompts* and not the *actual refined TAS list*, and the plan implies the TAS list is refined *after* prompt engineering (Step 3), there isn't a concrete 'refined TAS list' to transfer knowledge about yet. However, I can explain the *importance* of the refined TAS list and the *purpose* of the refined prompts that Lyra created, and how they will lead to a better TAS list in the next iteration. I will explain the concept of TAS, the importance of harmonization and refinement, and the role of the refined prompts in achieving this. I will also highlight how the TAS list and its refinement are crucial for setting up the subsequent steps like knowledge transfer and meta-reflection.",
  "output": "Hello team! As your AI Tutor, my goal is to ensure we all have a clear and shared understanding of our development plan, especially regarding the Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) for our simple TODO app. \n\nWe've completed the initial extraction and harmonization of TAS (Steps 1 & 2), leading to a unified list. Now, Lyra (Prompt Engineer) has refined the system prompts (Step 3) that will guide the TAS extractors in future iterations. These refined prompts are key to ensuring our TAS list becomes increasingly clear, consistent, and actionable. \n\n**Why is a refined TAS list so important?**\n\n*   **Clarity and Focus:** A well-defined TAS list acts as our roadmap. It breaks down the complex goal of 'building a simple TODO app' into manageable, understandable components. Each step should clearly state *what* needs to be done at a high level.\n*   **Interrelation and Dependencies:** Understanding how each TAS relates to others is crucial. For example, 'Design user interface' (TAS) must happen before or in parallel with 'Implement UI components' (a more detailed step that would emerge later). Knowing these connections helps us avoid bottlenecks and ensures a logical workflow.\n*   **Consistent Granularity:** We need to make sure our steps aren't too broad (like 'Build app') or too narrow (like 'Add event listener to button'). The refined prompts from Lyra are designed to help us achieve this consistent level of detail, making the plan easier for everyone to follow and execute.\n*   **Iterative Improvement:** The TAS list isn't static. We'll refine it iteratively. This means we start with high-level steps and progressively add detail. This approach allows for flexibility and ensures we don't get bogged down in specifics too early.\n\n**The Role of Refined Prompts:**\n\nLyra's refined prompts (output from T5) are designed to guide the TAS extractors to:\n1.  **Avoid Redundancy:** Ensure we don't have duplicate steps.\n2.  **Maintain Granularity:** Keep steps at a consistent level of detail.\n3.  **Guide Detail Expansion:** Help us add more specific information in subsequent iterations.\n\nBy focusing on these refined prompts, we are setting ourselves up for a robust and well-structured plan. Once the TAS extractors use these prompts in the next cycle, we will have an even clearer, more detailed TAS list to work with. \n\nOur next steps will involve Fizzlametta (Meta-Reflector) analyzing our collaboration and then the Orchestrator guiding us through another iteration based on this improved understanding. \n\nDoes this explanation of the TAS list's importance and the role of the refined prompts make sense to everyone?",
