    "reasoning": "The user wants to create a JSON representation of an iterative plan for developing a simple TODO app. The plan involves several AI agents with specific roles. The JSON should outline the reasoning, roles, and ordered tasks, including dependencies, based on the provided markdown file and team member descriptions. The plan starts with parallelized Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extraction, followed by harmonization, prompt refinement, knowledge transfer, meta-reflection, and an iterative expansion cycle. The 'Unknown' role for 'fizzlametta' needs to be addressed by assigning it the 'Meta-Reflector' role as described in Step 5 of the plan.",
