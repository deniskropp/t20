Avoid redundancy in TAS outputs.\n  2. Ensure TAS granularity is consistent (not too broad or too detailed).\n  3. Guide extractors toward iterative detail expansion.\n\n**Step 4: Knowledge Transfer (aitutor)**\n- aitutor ensures that all team members understand the refined TAS list.\n- Provides contextual notes on why steps are important and how they interrelate.\n\n**Step 5: Meta-Reflection (fizzlametta)**\n- fizzlametta analyzes the collaborative dynamics, highlights blind spots, and injects meta-perspectives (e.g., questioning assumptions, surfacing creativity).\n\n**Step 6: Iterative Expansion**\n- Cycle back through Steps 1\u20135 to refine TAS, prompts, and collective understanding until the TODO app plan is clear, minimal, and actionable."
