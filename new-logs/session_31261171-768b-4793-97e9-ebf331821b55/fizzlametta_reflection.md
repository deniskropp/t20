## Meta-Reflection on TODO App Development Plan

**Role:** Meta-Reflector (fizzlametta)
**Current Step:** T7 - Analyze collaborative dynamics, highlight blind spots, and inject meta-perspectives.
**Context:** Following AI Tutor's knowledge transfer (T6) on refined TAS and prompts.

### Analysis of Collaborative Dynamics & Blind Spots:

1.  **Over-reliance on 'Extraction' and 'Refinement':** The current steps heavily emphasize extracting and refining Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS). While crucial, this risks becoming a purely mechanical process. The inherent familiarity of a 'simple TODO app' can lead to unexamined assumptions about what constitutes 'simple' or 'complete'. We need to ensure we're capturing the *essence* of a useful app, not just a technically functional one.
2.  **Implicit Assumptions about 'Simple':** The plan lacks an explicit definition of 'simple'. This ambiguity can lead to divergent interpretations of requirements, impacting TAS and subsequent implementation. Core assumptions about user count, persistence, UI complexity, etc., should be clarified early.
3.  **User Experience (UX) vs. Functional Requirements:** TAS extraction currently leans towards functional requirements. The *user experience* of interacting with the TODO app is equally critical for usability. Are UX considerations sufficiently prompted for and captured in the TAS?
4.  **Timing of Meta-Reflection:** My role is placed *after* significant TAS and prompt refinement. While this allows reflection on the process, an earlier meta-analysis could question the *product's core definition* and initial strategies, potentially preventing misdirection before extensive refinement.
5.  **Interdependencies and Sequencing:** The AI Tutor highlighted interdependencies. The *order* of TAS refinement could significantly impact downstream roles (Designer, Engineer). For instance, defining UI flows early might better inform data storage needs than refining data storage TAS first.

### Injecting Meta-Perspectives:

*   **Define 'Simple TODO App' Explicitly:** Before the next iteration, establish a shared, baseline definition of 'simple' (e.g., core features, constraints) to create a common mental model.
*   **Prompt for User-Centricity:** Incorporate explicit prompts for user interaction and workflow considerations into TAS extraction and prompt engineering. Examples: 'Define intuitive task completion flow,' 'Ensure clear visual feedback on task status.'
*   **Consider Early UX Input:** Explore involving conceptual UX considerations during TAS refinement, even without a dedicated UX role at this stage, to ensure aesthetic and usability aspects are captured.
*   **Proactive Meta-Analysis:** In future iterations, consider brief meta-analyses preceding key harmonization or refinement steps to ensure the *direction* of refinement is sound before effort is invested.

### Conclusion:

The iterative plan is robust. My role is to ensure we build the *right* simple TODO app and that our collaboration is insightful. The Orchestrator's next task is critical for integrating these reflections and guiding the ongoing refinement process.
