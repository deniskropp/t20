The overall goal is: 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions, system prompt engineering'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Structure the consolidated task-agnostic steps into clear, actionable instructions for subsequent agents. Engineer system prompts for each agent based on their roles and the identified steps.'

The team's roles are:
    {'reasoning': "The initial step is to break down the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP' into actionable, task-agnostic steps. This requires the expertise of the 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' roles. Once these steps are identified, the 'Prompt Engineer' (Lyra) will be crucial for structuring these steps into clear instructions for other agents. The 'AI Tutor' (aitutor) will facilitate knowledge transfer, ensuring all agents understand the refined steps. The 'Designer' (Aurora) and 'Engineer' (Kodax) will then work on the visual and implementation aspects, respectively, based on the engineered prompts.

  "reasoning": "The user wants me to consolidate and synthesize the task-agnostic steps (TAS) identified by GPTASe, TASe, and uTASe for the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'. I need to review the TAS provided by each agent, identify common themes and unique contributions, and then produce a unified, comprehensive list of TAS that adheres to the specified schema. I will prioritize clarity, domain-agnosticism, and completeness in the synthesized output.",
  "output": "The consolidated Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) for achieving the 'Higher Self MTC-LCP' goal have been synthesized from the inputs of GPTASe, TASe, and uTASe. This unified set aims to provide a comprehensive, domain-agnostic framework for approaching such an objective. The steps cover the entire lifecycle from initial definition and analysis through planning, execution, monitoring, and refinement, ensuring a robust and iterative process. Each step is designed to be applicable across various contexts, focusing on fundamental actions required for self-improvement and goal attainment.",
