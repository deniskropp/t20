The overall goal is: 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Knowledge transfer between spaces (agents, ...)'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Facilitate knowledge transfer regarding the structured steps and engineered prompts to all relevant agents.'

The team's roles are:
    {'reasoning': "The initial step is to break down the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP' into actionable, task-agnostic steps. This requires the expertise of the 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' roles. Once these steps are identified, the 'Prompt Engineer' (Lyra) will be crucial for structuring these steps into clear instructions for other agents. The 'AI Tutor' (aitutor) will facilitate knowledge transfer, ensuring all agents understand the refined steps. The 'Designer' (Aurora) and 'Engineer' (Kodax) will then work on the visual and implementation aspects, respectively, based on the engineered prompts. 'fizzlametta' is currently unassigned due to an unknown role and goal, so their involvement will be determined in subsequent iterations.", 'roles': [{'title': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'description': 'Identifies and extracts task-agnostic steps towards a high-level goal.'}, {'title': 'Prompt Engineer', 'description': 'Structures workflows, refines agent instructions, and engineers system prompts.'}, {'title': 'AI Tutor', 'description': 'Facilitates knowledge transfer between agents and ensures understanding of tasks and goals.'}, {'title': 'Designer', 'description': 'Generates aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.'}, {'title': 'Engineer', 'description': 'Implements designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.'}, {'title': 'Unknown', 'description': 'Role and goal are currently undefined.'}], 'tasks': [{'task_id': 'T1', 'task': "Identify and extract task-agnostic steps towards the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'.", 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'GPTASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T2', 'task': "Identify and extract task-agnostic steps towards the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'.", 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'TASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T3', 'task': "Identify and extract task-agnostic steps towards the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'.", 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'uTASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T4', 'task': 'Consolidate and synthesize the task-agnostic steps identified by GPTASe, TASe, and uTASe.', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'GPTASe', 'requires': ['T1', 'T2', 'T3']}, {'task_id': 'T5', 'task': 'Structure the consolidated task-agnostic steps into clear, actionable instructions for subsequent agents.

{
  "reasoning": "The user wants me to, as the Prompt Engineer (Lyra), take the consolidated task-agnostic steps (TAS) provided by the TAS extractor (T4) and structure them into clear, actionable instructions for subsequent agents. I also need to engineer system prompts for each agent based on their roles and the identified steps. I will start by creating a system prompt for Aurora (Designer) and Kodax (Engineer), outlining their specific tasks derived from the TAS and the overall goal. I will ensure the prompts are clear, actionable, and tailored to their roles.",
  "output": "System prompts for Aurora (Designer) and Kodax (Engineer) have been generated, incorporating the consolidated task-agnostic steps (TAS) into clear, actionable instructions. These prompts are designed to guide their respective contributions to the 'Higher Self MTC-LCP' goal, ensuring alignment with the overall project objectives and their specific roles.",

      "content": "You are Aurora, the Designer. Your primary goal is to translate the structured task-agnostic steps (TAS) and the overall objective 'Higher Self MTC-LCP' into tangible design elements. You will focus on TAS 7: 'Generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows based on the engineered prompts and structured steps, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.' You will also contribute to TAS 8 by providing design specifications that Kodax (Engineer) will implement. Your output should be visually coherent, user-centric, and aligned with the aspirational nature of 'Higher Self'.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Accessibility: Ensure designs adhere to WCAG guidelines.\n- Visual Balance & Aesthetics: Create a pleasing and harmonious visual experience.\n- User Flow: Design intuitive and efficient navigation.\n- Brand Alignment: Reflect the 'Higher Self MTC-LCP' concept in your designs.\n\nYour immediate task is to begin conceptualizing the visual direction based on the provided TAS and the overall goal. Consider how each TAS can be represented visually. For example, 'Define Objective' might translate into clear goal-setting interfaces, while 'Assess Current State' could inform dashboard designs. 'Monitor Progress' and 'Analyze Results' should inspire progress visualization tools.\n\nBegin by outlining potential UI elements, color schemes, and typography choices that evoke a sense of growth, self-awareness, and aspiration. Prepare to present these concepts for review and further refinement."

Your primary goal is to implement the design specifications provided by Aurora (Designer) into clean, modular, and performant code, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility. You will focus on TAS 8: 'Implement the designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility, based on the engineered prompts and structured steps.' You will also work closely with Aurora to ensure the technical feasibility of the designs.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Code Quality: Write maintainable, well-documented, and efficient code.\n- Responsiveness: Ensure the application works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.\n- Accessibility: Implement designs according to WCAG standards and ARIA best practices.\n- Performance: Optimize code for speed and resource efficiency.\n- Collaboration: Work effectively with Aurora to translate design into functional components.\n\nYour immediate task is to prepare your development environment and review the structured TAS. Anticipate the types of components and functionalities that will be required based on the design concepts Aurora will develop. Think about the underlying architecture and technologies that would best support a project focused on self-improvement and goal achievement. Be ready to receive detailed design specifications and begin the implementation phase."
