The overall goal is: 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and return each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Identify and extract task-agnostic steps towards the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'.'

The team's roles are:
    {'reasoning': "The initial step is to break down the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP' into actionable, task-agnostic steps. This requires the expertise of the 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' roles. Once these steps are identified, the 'Prompt Engineer' (Lyra) will be crucial for structuring these steps into clear instructions for other agents. The 'AI Tutor' (aitutor) will facilitate knowledge transfer, ensuring all agents understand the refined steps. The 'Designer' (Aurora) and 'Engineer' (Kodax) will then work on the visual and implementation aspects, respectively, based on the engineered prompts. 'fizzlametta' is currently unassigned due to an unknown role and goal, so their involvement will be determined in subsequent iterations.", 'roles': [{'title': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'description': 'Identifies and extracts task-agnostic steps towards a high-level goal.'}, {'title': 'Prompt Engineer', 'description': 'Structures workflows, refines agent instructions, and engineers system prompts.'}, {'title': 'AI Tutor', 'description': 'Facilitates knowledge transfer between agents and ensures understanding of tasks and goals.'}, {'title': 'Designer', 'description': 'Generates aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.'}, {'title': 'Engineer', 'description': 'Implements designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.'}, {'title': 'Unknown', 'description': 'Role and goal are currently undefined.'}], 'tasks': [{'task_id': 'T1', 'task': "Identify and extract task-agnostic steps towards the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'.", 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'GPTASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T2', 'task': "Identify and extract task-agnostic steps towards the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'.", 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'TASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T3', 'task': "Identify and extract task-agnostic steps towards the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'.", 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'uTASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T4', 'task': 'Consolidate and synthesize the task-agnostic steps identified by GPTASe, TASe, and uTASe.', 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'GPTASe', 'requires': ['T1', 'T2', 'T3']}, {'task_id': 'T5', 'task': 'Structure the consolidated task-agnostic steps into clear, actionable instructions for subsequent agents.
