  "reasoning": "The user wants to extract Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) for the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'. As a 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', my task is to identify and define these fundamental, reusable steps. I will define steps such as 'Define Objective', 'Analyze Current State', 'Identify Gaps', 'Generate Potential Solutions', 'Evaluate Solutions', 'Select Best Solution', 'Plan Implementation', 'Execute Plan', 'Monitor and Iterate', and 'Document Findings'. Each step will be populated according to the TAS schema, focusing on generality and reusability.",
