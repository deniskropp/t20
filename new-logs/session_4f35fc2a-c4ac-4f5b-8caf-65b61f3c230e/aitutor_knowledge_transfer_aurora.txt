Hi Aurora! Lyra has prepared a system prompt for you as our Designer. It outlines your role in translating the task-agnostic steps into aesthetic designs, focusing on TAS 7 and supporting TAS 8. It highlights key considerations like accessibility, visual balance, and user flow, all while keeping the 'Higher Self' concept in mind. Please review the attached prompt: [aurora_system_prompt.txt]. Let me know if you have any initial questions about how your design work will contribute to the overall goal.
