  "reasoning": "The user wants to identify task-agnostic steps (TAS) for the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'. This requires breaking down the abstract goal into fundamental, domain-independent actions. I will generate a set of TAS that represent the core activities needed to achieve such a goal, focusing on a general process of improvement and self-optimization. The steps will cover defining objectives, analyzing current state, planning interventions, executing changes, and reviewing outcomes.",
