The overall goal is: 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Implement designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Implement the designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility, based on the engineered prompts and structured steps.'

The team's roles are:
    {'reasoning': "The initial step is to break down the high-level goal 'Higher Self MTC-LCP' into actionable, task-agnostic steps. This requires the expertise of the 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' roles. Once these steps are identified, the 'Prompt Engineer' (Lyra) will be crucial for structuring these steps into clear instructions for other agents. The 'AI Tutor' (aitutor) will facilitate knowledge transfer, ensuring all agents understand the refined steps. The 'Designer' (Aurora) and 'Engineer' (Kodax) will then work on the visual and implementation aspects, respectively, based on the engineered prompts.

  "reasoning": "The user wants me to act as Aurora, the Designer, and generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows for 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'. I have received input from the AI Tutor (aitutor) which includes my system prompt, outlining my role, key considerations (accessibility, visual balance, user flow, brand alignment), and an immediate task to conceptualize visual direction. The system prompt also mentions translating task-agnostic steps (TAS) into visual elements. My process will involve breaking down the conceptualization into specific design elements as requested by the user and my system prompt.",
  "output": "As Aurora, the Designer, I will now conceptualize the visual direction for 'Higher Self MTC-LCP'. My approach will focus on creating an interface that is clean, inspiring, and conducive to self-improvement, embodying the essence of 'Higher Self'. I will ensure all design choices prioritize accessibility and visual harmony.",
