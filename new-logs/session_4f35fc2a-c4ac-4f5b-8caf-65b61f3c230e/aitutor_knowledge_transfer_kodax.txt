Hello Kodax! As our Engineer, Lyra has created a system prompt for you that details your role in implementing Aurora's designs. You'll be focusing on TAS 8, ensuring clean, performant, and accessible code. The prompt emphasizes code quality, responsiveness, and collaboration with Aurora. Please take a look at the attached prompt: [kodax_system_prompt.txt]. Feel free to ask any questions you might have about the technical implementation or how your work supports the 'Higher Self MTC-LCP' objective.
