## Strategy for Integrating Data from Specified External Sources (T20)

This document outlines the strategy for integrating data from specified external sources into the 3D API ecosystem, building upon the foundational `Plan for Data Ingestion and Management` (T13) and acknowledging the implementation focus of `Initial Data Ingestion Pipelines` (T18).

### 1. Identification and Prioritization of External Sources

The first step is to identify and categorize potential external data sources. These could include:

*   **Public 3D Model Repositories:** (e.g., Sketchfab, TurboSquid, CGTrader - subject to API access and licensing).
*   **Asset Management Systems (AMS):** Internal or third-party AMS that store 3D assets.
*   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Where assets might be pre-cached or managed.
*   **Specialized Data Providers:** For textures, material libraries, or specific 3D data formats.
*   **User-Provided Datasets:** Specific datasets that users may grant permission to integrate.

Prioritization will be based on factors such as:

*   Relevance to the 3D API's core functionality.
*   Availability and quality of APIs or data export mechanisms.
*   Licensing and usage rights.
*   Data volume and update frequency.

### 2. Integration Methods

We will employ a variety of integration methods depending on the nature of the external source:

*   **API-Based Integration:**
    *   **Description:** Directly querying external APIs to fetch asset metadata, download links, or even asset data itself.
    *   **Process:** Develop connectors or adapters for each specific external API. This will involve handling authentication (API keys, OAuth), request formatting, response parsing, and error handling.
    *   **Example:** A connector to fetch a list of available models from a 3D model repository API, including their metadata and download URLs.
*   **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes:**
    *   **Description:** For sources that provide data dumps or require batch processing (e.g., CSV files, database dumps, scheduled file transfers).
    *   **Process:** Develop scripts or use ETL tools to extract data from the source, transform it into our standardized format (e.g., converting metadata schemas, ensuring consistent file naming), and load it into our system (e.g., S3 and our database).
    *   **Example:** A nightly ETL job that pulls new texture assets from a partner's FTP server, validates them, and imports them.
*   **Webhooks and Real-time Updates:**
    *   **Description:** Setting up listeners for webhooks provided by external services to receive real-time notifications about data changes.
    *   **Process:** Implement endpoints to receive webhook payloads and trigger appropriate ingestion or update workflows.
    *   **Example:** Receiving a webhook notification from an external AMS when a new version of a 3D asset is published.
*   **Direct File/Database Access (Less Preferred):**
    *   **Description:** In cases where APIs are not available, direct access to file shares or databases might be considered, but this is generally less scalable and maintainable.
    *   **Process:** Securely establish connections and implement data extraction logic.

### 3. Data Flow and Workflow

1.  **Source Connection & Authentication:** Establish secure connections to external sources using provided credentials or OAuth flows.
2.  **Data Extraction:** Fetch data (metadata, file pointers, or actual files) based on the chosen integration method.
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   **Metadata Mapping:** Map fields from the external source's schema to our internal schema.
    *   **Format Standardization:** Ensure 3D model formats, textures, etc., are compatible or converted to our standard formats (e.g., glTF, PBR textures).
    *   **Validation:** Apply data validation rules (as per `LaDataVal` - T19) to ensure data integrity and consistency.
4.  **Ingestion into Our System:**
    *   **Asset Storage (AWS S3):** Upload raw asset files to S3.
    *   **Database Storage (PostgreSQL/MongoDB):** Store extracted and transformed metadata in our database, linking it to the S3 location.
5.  **Processing & Indexing:** Trigger asynchronous processing workers (via message queue) for format conversion, optimization, thumbnail generation, and indexing, similar to the direct upload pipeline.
6.  **Error Handling & Monitoring:** Implement robust error handling for each integration point and monitor the health and performance of these pipelines.

### 4. Role of Data Validator (T19)

The `Data Validator` will play a crucial role in ensuring that data ingested from external sources meets the same quality and integrity standards as internally uploaded assets. This includes validating metadata schemas, file formats, and potentially performing checks on the 3D data itself.

### 5. Role of Ingestion Specialist (T18)

The `Ingestion Specialist` will implement the specific connectors and ETL scripts required for each external source, ensuring they integrate seamlessly with the overall ingestion pipeline, including the message queue and initial validation steps.

### 6. Security Considerations

*   Secure storage of API keys and credentials.
*   Enforcement of rate limits for external API calls.
*   Compliance with the terms of service and data usage policies of external sources.

This strategy provides a framework for systematically integrating data from diverse external sources, ensuring consistency, quality, and security throughout the process.
