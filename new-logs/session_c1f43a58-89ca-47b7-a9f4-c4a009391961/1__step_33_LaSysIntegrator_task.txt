  "output": "## 3D API: Initial System Design\n\nThis document outlines the initial system design for the 3D API, synthesizing the high-level architecture, functional/non-functional requirements, and core conceptual abstractions. It provides a more detailed blueprint for the development team.\n\n### 1. Architectural Decisions & Technology Stack\n\nBased on the microservices architecture (T1) and requirements (T2), the following technology stack is proposed:\n\n*   **API Gateway:** \n    *   **Technology:** Kong API Gateway.\n    *   **Rationale:** Offers robust features for routing, authentication (JWT, OAuth2), rate limiting, and plugin extensibility. Its declarative configuration supports microservices.\n*   **Core Services (Geometry, Scene, Rendering, Material, Animation):**\n    *   **Language/Framework:** Python (FastAPI/Flask) for rapid development and rich ecosystem, or Go for performance-critical services.\n    *   **Rationale:** Python offers libraries for 3D manipulation (e.g., `trimesh`, `Open3D`) and web frameworks suitable for microservices. Go provides excellent concurrency and performance for compute-intensive tasks like rendering.\n    *   **Containerization:** Docker.\n    *   **Rationale:** Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   **Asset Storage:** AWS S3 or compatible object storage (e.g., MinIO).\n    *   **Rationale:** Scalable, durable, and cost-effective storage for large binary assets like 3D models and textures.\n    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension (for potential spatial queries) or MongoDB.\n    *   **Rationale:** PostgreSQL offers relational integrity and powerful features. MongoDB provides flexibility for evolving metadata schemas.\n*   **Asynchronous Processing:**\n    *   **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or Kafka.\n    *   **Rationale:** Robust message queuing systems for decoupling services and handling background tasks reliably. RabbitMQ is simpler for basic queuing, while Kafka offers higher throughput and stream processing capabilities.\n*   **Inter-service Communication:** RESTful APIs for synchronous requests (e.g., to API Gateway) and gRPC for high-performance internal communication between core services where latency is critical. Asynchronous communication via the Message Queue.\n*   **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes.\n*   **Rationale:** Manages deployment, scaling, and networking of containerized microservices.\n\n### 2. Data Models\n\nBuilding upon the conceptual abstractions (T4), the following data models will guide the implementation:\n\n*   **`Asset` Object:** \n    *   Schema will include `asset_id`, `asset_type`, `file_format`, `storage_path` (in S3), `upload_timestamp`, `metadata` (JSONB field).\n*   **`Model` Representation:** \n    *   Geometry data will be stored efficiently (e.g., binary format, potentially optimized for web delivery like glTF). Metadata will include vertex/triangle counts, bounding boxes.\n*   **`Scene` Object:** \n    *   Will store scene graph structure, references to `Asset` IDs for models, materials, lights, and cameras. Stored in the primary database.\n*   **`RenderJob` Object:**\n    *   Schema will include `job_id`, `scene_id`, `camera_config`, `output_format`, `resolution`, `status` (enum), `created_at`, `completed_at`, `output_path`.\n\n### 3. API Design Considerations\n\n*   **RESTful Principles:** Adhere to RESTful principles for external-facing APIs.\n*   **Versioning:** Implement API versioning (e.g., `/v1/...`).\n*   **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication, managed by the API Gateway.\n*   **Standard Formats:** Prioritize glTF for model exchange due to its web-friendliness and extensibility.\n*   **Error Handling:** Consistent error response format across all endpoints.\n*   **Documentation:** OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for generating interactive documentation.\n\n**Example Endpoints:**\n\n*   `POST /v1/assets/upload`: Upload a new asset.\n*   `GET /v1/assets/{asset_id}`: Retrieve asset metadata.\n*   `POST /v1/scenes`: Create a new scene.\n*   `PUT /v1/scenes/{scene_id}`: Update an existing scene.\n*   `POST /v1/renderjobs`: Submit a new render job.\n*   `GET /v1/renderjobs/{job_id}`: Get render job status and output URL.\n\n### 4. Workflow & Interaction Patterns\n\n*   **Asset Upload:** Client uploads asset -> API Gateway -> Geometry Service (validation, metadata extraction) -> Stores in S3 -> Records metadata in DB -> Returns `asset_id`.\n*   **Scene Creation/Update:** Client defines scene structure (referencing `asset_id`s) -> API Gateway -> Scene Management Service -> Stores/updates scene definition in DB.\n*   **Rendering Request:** Client requests render -> API Gateway -> Scene Service (retrieves scene) -> API Gateway -> Rendering Service (creates `RenderJob` entry, publishes message to Queue) -> Worker picks up job -> Rendering Service processes -> Stores output in S3 -> Updates `RenderJob` status in DB.\n*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use of message queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for decoupling long-running tasks (rendering, complex model processing, conversions) from the main API request flow.\n\n### 5. Deployment Strategy\n\n*   **Infrastructure:** Cloud-based (AWS, GCP, Azure) leveraging managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS).\n*   **CI/CD:** Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) for automated building, testing, and deployment of microservices.\n*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for all services.\n\n### 6. Security Considerations\n\n*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Handled at the API Gateway. Fine-grained authorization within services as needed.\n*   **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation at the API Gateway and service levels to prevent malformed data or security exploits.\n*   **Secure Storage:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (HTTPS for all external communication).\n\nThis initial system design provides a concrete foundation for the subsequent development phases. It balances flexibility with the need for a robust and scalable architecture.",

  "output": "## Implementation Plan: Initial Data Ingestion Pipelines\n\nThis document outlines the implementation of the initial data ingestion pipelines for the 3D API, building upon the `Plan for Data Ingestion and Management` (T13).\n\n### 1. Direct Upload API Endpoint (`/v1/assets/upload`)\n\nThis endpoint will serve as the primary mechanism for direct asset uploads.\n\n*   **Technology Stack:** To be implemented using the chosen API Gateway and a dedicated microservice (e.g., Geometry Service).\n*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`\n*   **Request:**\n    *   **Headers:** `Content-Type` (e.g., `multipart/form-data`), `Authorization` (for authentication).\n    *   **Body:** The asset file itself (e.g., glTF, OBJ, PNG) and any associated metadata as form fields.\n*   **Functionality:**\n    1.  **Authentication & Authorization:** Verify the user's credentials and permissions.\n    2.  **File Reception:** Receive the uploaded file and metadata.\n    3.  **Basic Validation (Initial Ingestion - T18):\n        *   **File Type Check:** Verify the uploaded file's extension and/or MIME type against a list of supported formats (e.g., `.gltf`, `.glb`, `.obj`, `.fbx`, `.png`, `.jpg`).\n        *   **File Size Check:** Enforce a maximum file size limit to prevent abuse and manage resources.\n        *   **Metadata Presence:** Ensure essential metadata fields (if any are required at this stage) are present.\n    4.  **Temporary Storage:** Store the uploaded file temporarily.\n    5.  **Orchestration:** Initiate the next steps in the ingestion pipeline:\n        *   Publish a message to the message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) containing the file location and initial metadata.\n        *   Return a `202 Accepted` response to the client, indicating that the upload has been received and processing has begun, along with an asset ID or tracking identifier.\n*   **Error Handling:** Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `400 Bad Request` for validation errors, `413 Payload Too Large`, `500 Internal Server Error` for processing failures).\n\n### 2. Initial Validation Service/Module\n\nThis component will be responsible for performing the initial checks on uploaded assets.\n\n*   **Responsibilities:**\n    *   Execute the validation rules defined in step 1.3.\n    *   If validation fails, generate an error response and log the failure.\n    *   If validation passes, prepare the asset for the next stage (e.g., uploading to S3).\n*   **Implementation Details:** This can be a dedicated microservice or a module within the Geometry Service.\n\n### 3. Message Queue Integration\n\n*   **Purpose:** Decouple the upload endpoint from the subsequent processing steps, allowing for asynchronous handling and scalability.\n*   **Event:** A new message will be published to a designated queue (e.g., `asset-ingestion-queue`) upon successful initial validation.\n*   **Message Payload:** `{ \"asset_id\": \"<generated_uuid>\", \"original_filename\": \"...\", \"file_path\": \"<temporary_storage_path>\", \"metadata\": { ... } }`\n\n### 4. Interaction with Storage and Processing\n\n*   **Asset Storage (AWS S3):** The subsequent processing worker (triggered by the message queue) will be responsible for moving the file from temporary storage to its permanent location in S3.\n*   **Database:** Metadata will be initially recorded in the database with a status of 'processing' or similar.\n*   **Background Workers:** These workers will consume messages from the queue to perform more in-depth validation, format conversion, and other processing tasks (as defined in T13 and T19).\n\n### 5. Future Enhancements (Post Initial Implementation)\n\n*   **Batch Ingestion:** Development of scripts and infrastructure for bulk data loading.\n*   **External Source Integration:** Implementing connectors for specific external data sources (T20).\n*   **Advanced Validation:** Integrating more sophisticated checks for 3D model integrity and texture quality.\n\nThis implementation plan focuses on establishing the foundational direct upload pipeline, ensuring that assets can be received, minimally validated, and queued for further processing.",

Direct Upload API Endpoint (`/v1/assets/upload`)\n\nThis endpoint will serve as the primary mechanism for direct asset uploads.\n\n*   **Technology Stack:** To be implemented using the chosen API Gateway and a dedicated microservice (e.g., Geometry Service).\n*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`\n*   **Request:**\n    *   **Headers:** `Content-Type` (e.g., `multipart/form-data`), `Authorization` (for authentication).\n    *   **Body:** The asset file itself (e.g., glTF, OBJ, PNG) and any associated metadata as form fields.\n*   **Functionality:**\n    1.  **Authentication & Authorization:** Verify the user's credentials and permissions.\n    2.  **File Reception:** Receive the uploaded file and metadata.\n    3.  **Basic Validation (Initial Ingestion - T18):\n        *   **File Type Check:** Verify the uploaded file's extension and/or MIME type against a list of supported formats (e.g., `.gltf`, `.glb`, `.obj`, `.fbx`, `.png`, `.jpg`).\n        *   **File Size Check:** Enforce a maximum file size limit to prevent abuse and manage resources.\n        *   **Metadata Presence:** Ensure essential metadata fields (if any are required at this stage) are present.\n    4.  **Temporary Storage:** Store the uploaded file temporarily.\n    5.  **Orchestration:** Initiate the next steps in the ingestion pipeline:\n        *   Publish a message to the message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) containing the file location and initial metadata.\n        *   Return a `202 Accepted` response to the client, indicating that the upload has been received and processing has begun, along with an asset ID or tracking identifier.\n*   **Error Handling:** Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `400 Bad Request` for validation errors, `413 Payload Too Large`, `500 Internal Server Error` for processing failures).\n\n### 2. Initial Validation Service/Module\n\nThis component will be responsible for performing the initial checks on uploaded assets.\n\n*   **Responsibilities:**\n    *   Execute the validation rules defined in step 1.3.\n    *   If validation fails, generate an error response and log the failure.\n    *   If validation passes, prepare the asset for the next stage (e.g., uploading to S3).\n*   **Implementation Details:** This can be a dedicated microservice or a module within the Geometry Service.\n\n### 3. Message Queue Integration\n\n*   **Purpose:** Decouple the upload endpoint from the subsequent processing steps, allowing for asynchronous handling and scalability.\n*   **Event:** A new message will be published to a designated queue (e.g., `asset-ingestion-queue`) upon successful initial validation.\n*   **Message Payload:** `{ \"asset_id\": \"<generated_uuid>\", \"original_filename\": \"...\", \"file_path\": \"<temporary_storage_path>\", \"metadata\": { ... } }`\n\n### 4. Interaction with Storage and Processing\n\n*   **Asset Storage (AWS S3):** The subsequent processing worker (triggered by the message queue) will be responsible for moving the file from temporary storage to its permanent location in S3.\n*   **Database:** Metadata will be initially recorded in the database with a status of 'processing' or similar.\n*   **Background Workers:** These workers will consume messages from the queue to perform more in-depth validation, format conversion, and other processing tasks (as defined in T13 and T19).\n\n### 5. Future Enhancements (Post Initial Implementation)\n\n*   **Batch Ingestion:** Development of scripts and infrastructure for bulk data loading.\n*   **External Source Integration:** Implementing connectors for specific external data sources (T20).\n*   **Advanced Validation:** Integrating more sophisticated checks for 3D model integrity and texture quality.\n\nThis implementation plan focuses on establishing the foundational direct upload pipeline, ensuring that assets can be received, minimally validated, and queued for further processing."

  "output": "## Data Validation Rules and Procedures for the 3D API\n\nThis document defines the data validation rules and procedures to ensure the integrity, quality, and consistency of data ingested into the 3D API. These procedures build upon the initial validation performed during upload (T18) and the overall data management plan (T13).\n\n### 1. Validation Stages and Types\n\nData validation will occur at multiple stages of the ingestion pipeline:\n\n*   **Stage 1: In-Transit Validation (API Endpoint - T18):** Performed immediately upon receiving an asset. Focuses on basic integrity and format.\n*   **Stage 2: Pre-Processing Validation (Ingestion Pipeline):** Performed after initial upload but before intensive processing or storage. Ensures data is ready for transformation.\n*   **Stage 3: Post-Processing Validation (Ingestion Pipeline):** Performed after data transformation or conversion. Verifies the success and correctness of the processing steps.\n*   **Stage 4: Data-at-Rest Validation (Ongoing):** Periodic checks on data already stored to detect corruption or drift.\n\n### 2. Specific Validation Rules\n\n**2.1. File-Level Validation (Stage 1):\n\n*   **File Type:** Check against a predefined list of supported file extensions and MIME types (e.g., `.gltf`, `.glb`, `.obj`, `.fbx`, `.stl`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`). Reject unsupported types.\n*   **File Size:** Enforce maximum and minimum file size limits. Reject files that are too large or empty.\n*   **Integrity Check:** For certain formats (e.g., compressed archives), perform a basic integrity check (e.g., CRC check if applicable).\n\n**2.2. Metadata Validation (Stage 1 & 2):\n\n*   **Schema Conformance:** Validate all provided metadata against predefined JSON schemas. This ensures expected fields, data types, and formats (e.g., dates, UUIDs, numerical ranges).\n*   **Required Fields:** Ensure all mandatory metadata fields are present.\n*   **Value Constraints:** Check if metadata values fall within acceptable ranges or adhere to specific formats (e.g., valid enum values, positive integers for counts).\n*   **Uniqueness:** For specific fields (e.g., asset IDs, user IDs), ensure uniqueness.\n\n**2.3. 3D Model Content Validation (Stage 2 & 3):\n\n*   **Format Specific Parsing:** Attempt to parse the 3D model file using relevant libraries (e.g., `assimp`, `gltf-transform`). Fail if parsing errors occur.\n*   **Geometry Integrity:**\n    *   **Manifold Meshes:** Check for non-manifold geometry (e.g., holes, self-intersections) where applicable.\n    *   **Valid Normals & UVs:** Ensure normals are consistent and UV coordinates are within expected ranges.\n    *   **Vertex/Triangle Count:** Check against reasonable limits to prevent excessively complex models.\n*   **Texture Validation:**\n    *   **Format & Size:** Verify texture image files are valid and within size limits.\n    *   **Color Space:** Ensure textures use appropriate color spaces (e.g., sRGB for albedo, linear for normal maps).\n*   **Scene Graph Consistency:** For scene description files, validate hierarchy structure and transformation matrix validity.\n\n**2.4. Data Transformation Validation (Stage 3):\n\n*   **Conversion Success:** Verify that format conversions (e.g., OBJ to glTF) completed without errors.\n*   **Output Integrity:** Re-run critical content validation checks on the converted/processed asset to ensure no degradation or corruption occurred.\n*   **Metadata Updates:** Ensure any metadata generated or modified during processing is valid.\n\n**2.5. Data-at-Rest Validation (Stage 4):\n\n*   **Checksum Verification:** Periodically re-calculate and verify checksums of stored assets against stored values.\n*   **File System Checks:** Run file system integrity checks on storage volumes.\n*   **Data Sampling:** Randomly sample stored data and re-run validation checks to detect silent corruption.\n\n### 3. Validation Procedures and Implementation\n\n*   **Automated Checks:** All validation rules (except Stage 4) will be automated as part of the ingestion pipeline.\n*   **Schema Management:** A central repository for JSON schemas will be maintained. Tools like `ajv` (for Node.js) or similar libraries will be used for schema validation.\n*   **Processing Libraries:** Leverage established libraries for parsing and validating 3D file formats (e.g., `gltf-transform`, `three.js` loaders, `assimp`).\n*   **Error Reporting:** Validation failures will be logged with detailed information (file, rule violated, error message). Notifications will be sent for critical failures.\n*   **Quarantine/Rejection:** Assets failing Stage 1 or Stage 2 validation may be rejected outright or moved to a quarantine area for manual review. Assets failing Stage 3 validation will trigger rollback or re-processing attempts.\n*   **Feedback Loop:** Validation results will feed back into the `Improvement Analyst` (T29) and `Refinement Strategist` (T30) for identifying common issues and improving data quality over time.\n*   **Data Validator Role (T19):** This role is responsible for defining, implementing, and maintaining these validation rules and procedures, working closely with `Data Engineer` (T13) and `Ingestion Specialist` (T18).",

  "output": "## 3D API: Response Generation Strategies\n\nThis document outlines the strategies for generating responses from the 3D API. The goal is to ensure that responses are consistent, informative, and facilitate effective communication between the API and its clients, whether they are human users interacting via a natural language interface or programmatic clients.\n\n### 1. Standard Response Formats\n\nAll successful API responses will adhere to a consistent JSON structure. This promotes predictability and simplifies client-side parsing.\n\n**1.1. Success Responses:**\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"message\": \"Operation completed successfully.\",\n      \"data\": { ... } // Optional: Contains the requested data or results of the operation.\n    }\n    ```\n*   **`status`:** Always \"success\" for a successful operation.\n*   **`message`:** A brief, human-readable confirmation message (e.g., \"Asset uploaded successfully.\", \"Scene created.\").\n*   **`data`:** This field will contain the primary payload of the response. Its structure will vary depending on the endpoint and the operation performed:\n    *   For `GET` requests returning a single resource: The resource object itself.\n    *   For `GET` requests returning a list: An array of resource objects, potentially with pagination metadata.\n    *   For `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT` requests: May contain the created/updated resource, its ID, or a confirmation of the action.\n    *   For asynchronous operations (e.g., rendering): May contain a job ID and status.\n\n**1.2. Error Responses:**\n\nError responses will also follow a standardized JSON format to provide clear information about what went wrong.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"error\",\n      \"error\": {\n        \"code\": \"API_ERROR_CODE\",\n        \"message\": \"A human-readable error message.\",\n        \"details\": { ... } // Optional: More specific details about the error.\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n*   **`status`:** Always \"error\" for an error condition.\n*   **`error`:** An object containing error details:\n    *   **`code`:** A machine-readable error code (e.g., `INVALID_INPUT`, `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`, `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`). These codes should be documented in the API specification.\n    *   **`message`:** A clear, concise explanation of the error, suitable for developers.\n    *   **`details`:** An optional object providing more granular information, such as validation errors for specific fields (e.g., `{ \"field\": \"email\", \"issue\": \"must be a valid email address\" }`).\n\n### 2. HTTP Status Codes\n\nIn addition to the JSON response body, appropriate HTTP status codes will be used to indicate the outcome of the request:\n\n*   **`200 OK`:** For successful `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH` requests.\n*   **`201 Created`:** For successful `POST` requests that result in resource creation.\n*   **`202 Accepted`:** For asynchronous operations initiated successfully (e.g., submitting a render job).\n*   **`204 No Content`:** For successful requests where no response body is needed (e.g., a `DELETE` operation).\n*   **`400 Bad Request`:** For client-side errors, such as invalid input or malformed requests.\n*   **`401 Unauthorized`:** When authentication is required but has failed or not been provided.\n*   **`403 Forbidden`:** When the user is authenticated but does not have permission to perform the action.\n*   **`404 Not Found`:** When the requested resource does not exist.\n*   **`409 Conflict`:** When the request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource (e.g., trying to create a resource that already exists with the same identifier).\n*   **`500 Internal Server Error`:** For unexpected server-side errors.\n*   **`503 Service Unavailable`:** When the server is temporarily unable to handle the request (e.g., due to maintenance or overload).\n\n### 3. Response Strategies Based on Operation Type\n\n**3.1. Data Retrieval (`GET`):**\n\n*   **Success:** Return the requested data in the `data` field with a `200 OK` status. Include pagination metadata if applicable.\n*   **Error:** Return `404 Not Found` if the resource doesn't exist, or `400 Bad Request` for invalid query parameters. Use the standard error JSON format.\n\n**3.2. Data Creation (`POST`):**\n\n*   **Success:** Return the created resource (or its identifier) in the `data` field with a `201 Created` status. Include a confirmation message.\n*   **Error:** Return `400 Bad Request` for validation errors. Use the standard error JSON format with detailed validation issues.\n\n**3.3. Data Updates (`PUT`, `PATCH`):**\n\n*   **Success:** Return the updated resource (or confirmation) in the `data` field with `200 OK`. A `204 No Content` may be used if no body is returned.\n*   **Error:** Return `404 Not Found` if the resource doesn't exist, or `400 Bad Request` for validation errors. Use the standard error JSON format.\n\n**3.4. Data Deletion (`DELETE`):**\n\n*   **Success:** Return `204 No Content` with an empty body.\n*   **Error:** Return `404 Not Found` if the resource doesn't exist.\n\n**3.5. Asynchronous Operations (e.g., Rendering):**\n\n*   **Initiation Success:** Return a `202 Accepted` status. The `data` field should contain a `job_id` and a link to check the job status (e.g., `\"status_url\": \"/renderjobs/{job_id}/status\"`).\n*   **Status Check Success:** Return `200 OK`. The `data` field will contain the current `status` (e.g., `\"pending\"`, `\"processing\"`, `\"completed\"`, `\"failed\"`) and potentially the output URL if completed.\n*   **Failure:** Return `200 OK` with status `\"failed\"` and include error details in the `error` object within the response, or return an appropriate HTTP error code (e.g., `500`) if the failure is severe.\n\n### 4. Feedback Generation for Natural Language Interaction\n\nResponses should be tailored to provide feedback that aligns with the linguistic mappings defined (T9).\n\n*   **Confirmation:** When a user command is successfully executed, provide a natural language confirmation that mirrors the user's intent (e.g., if the user said \"Create a scene named 'my_scene'\", the API response message could be \"Scene 'my_scene' created successfully.\").\n*   **Error Reporting:** Translate API error codes and messages into user-friendly language. For example, instead of returning `INVALID_INPUT` for a malformed transform, the message could be \"The provided transformation data is incorrect. Please check the format and values.\"\n*   **Progress Updates:** For long-running operations, provide intermediate status updates that can be relayed to the user (e.g., \"Rendering is 50% complete.\").\n\n### 5. Consistency and Documentation\n\n*   All response structures, error codes, and status messages must be meticulously documented in the OpenAPI specification.\n*   Regular reviews of response patterns will be conducted to ensure adherence to these strategies and to adapt them based on user feedback and evolving requirements.\n\nBy implementing these response generation strategies, the 3D API will provide a robust, predictable, and user-friendly interface.",

      "content": "## 3D API: Response Generation Strategies\n\nThis document outlines the strategies for generating responses from the 3D API. The goal is to ensure that responses are consistent, informative, and facilitate effective communication between the API and its clients, whether they are human users interacting via a natural language interface or programmatic clients.\n\n### 1. Standard Response Formats\n\nAll successful API responses will adhere to a consistent JSON structure. This promotes predictability and simplifies client-side parsing.\n\n**1.1. Success Responses:**\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"message\": \"Operation completed successfully.\",\n      \"data\": { ... } // Optional: Contains the requested data or results of the operation.\n    }\n    ```\n*   **`status`:** Always \"success\" for a successful operation.\n*   **`message`:** A brief, human-readable confirmation message (e.g., \"Asset uploaded successfully.\", \"Scene created.\").\n*   **`data`:** This field will contain the primary payload of the response. Its structure will vary depending on the endpoint and the operation performed:\n    *   For `GET` requests returning a single resource: The resource object itself.\n    *   For `GET` requests returning a list: An array of resource objects, potentially with pagination metadata.\n    *   For `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT` requests: May contain the created/updated resource, its ID, or a confirmation of the action.\n    *   For asynchronous operations (e.g., rendering): May contain a job ID and status.\n\n**1.2. Error Responses:**\n\nError responses will also follow a standardized JSON format to provide clear information about what went wrong.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"error\",\n      \"error\": {\n        \"code\": \"API_ERROR_CODE\",\n        \"message\": \"A human-readable error message.\",\n        \"details\": { ... } // Optional: More specific details about the error.\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n*   **`status`:** Always \"error\" for an error condition.\n*   **`error`:** An object containing error details:\n    *   **`code`:** A machine-readable error code (e.g., `INVALID_INPUT`, `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`, `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`). These codes should be documented in the API specification.\n    *   **`message`:** A clear, concise explanation of the error, suitable for developers.\n    *   **`details`:** An optional object providing more granular information, such as validation errors for specific fields (e.g., `{ \"field\": \"email\", \"issue\": \"must be a valid email address\" }`).\n\n### 2. HTTP Status Codes\n\nIn addition to the JSON response body, appropriate HTTP status codes will be used to indicate the outcome of the request:\n\n*   **`200 OK`:** For successful `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH` requests.\n*   **`201 Created`:** For successful `POST` requests that result in resource creation.\n*   **`202 Accepted`:** For asynchronous operations initiated successfully (e.g., submitting a render job).\n*   **`204 No Content`:** For successful requests where no response body is needed (e.g., a `DELETE` operation).\n*   **`400 Bad Request`:** For client-side errors, such as invalid input or malformed requests.\n*   **`401 Unauthorized`:** When authentication is required but has failed or not been provided.\n*   **`403 Forbidden`:** When the user is authenticated but does not have permission to perform the action.\n*   **`404 Not Found`:** When the requested resource does not exist.\n*   **`409 Conflict`:** When the request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource (e.g., trying to create a resource that already exists with the same identifier).\n*   **`500 Internal Server Error`:** For unexpected server-side errors.\n*   **`503 Service Unavailable`:** When the server is temporarily unable to handle the request (e.g., due to maintenance or overload).\n\n### 3.

These workflows aim to ensure efficient, scalable, and reliable execution of core functionalities.\n\n### 1. Asset Ingestion Workflow\n\nThis workflow covers the process from receiving an asset file to its storage and validation.\n\n*   **Trigger:** `POST /v1/assets/upload` request or batch ingestion process.\n*   **Actors:** API Gateway, Geometry Service, Asset Storage (S3), Database, Data Validator Service, Message Queue.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  **Request Reception:** API Gateway receives the upload request (file + metadata).\n    2.  **Initial Validation:** API Gateway performs authentication and basic request validation.\n    3.  **File Handling:** Request forwarded to Geometry Service. Service performs initial file checks (type, size) and generates a unique asset ID.\n    4.  **Storage:** Geometry Service uploads the raw asset file to AWS S3. The S3 path and initial metadata are stored in the Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB), associated with the asset ID.\n    5.  **Asynchronous Validation Trigger:** Geometry Service publishes a `asset_validated` message to the Message Queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) with the asset ID.\n    6.  **Data Validation:** A worker instance of the Data Validator Service consumes the message.\n    7.  **Content Validation:** Data Validator Service performs in-depth validation of the asset's geometry, materials, and textures. It may invoke specific parsing or analysis tools.\n    8.  **Status Update:** Data Validator Service updates the asset's status in the Database (e.g., 'VALIDATED', 'FAILED'). If validation fails, it logs the error details.\n    9.  **Optional Conversion:** If format conversion is required, the Data Validator Service publishes a `convert_asset` message to the Message Queue, triggering a conversion worker.\n    10. **Completion Notification:** Upon successful validation (and optional conversion), the Data Validator Service can publish a `asset_ready` message for downstream services.\n*   **Optimization Notes:** Utilize S3 multipart uploads for large files.

Provide clear feedback to the client on job submission status.\n\n### 4. Rendering Execution Workflow (Worker)\n\nThis workflow describes the process executed by rendering worker instances.\n\n*   **Trigger:** Consumption of `render_job_submitted` message from the Message Queue.\n*   **Actors:** Rendering Worker, Asset Storage (S3), Database, Rendering Engine.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  **Job Consumption:** Rendering Worker picks up a `render_job_submitted` message.\n    2.  **Status Update:** Worker updates the `RenderJob` status in the Database to 'PROCESSING'.\n    3.  **Asset Fetching:** Worker retrieves necessary scene data and asset files (models, textures) from S3 based on the scene information.\n    4.  **Rendering Execution:** Worker utilizes the Rendering Engine to perform the rendering based on the job parameters (camera, resolution, etc.).\n    5.  **Output Storage:** Rendered output is uploaded to S3.\n    6.  **Database Update:** Worker updates the `RenderJob` status in the Database to 'COMPLETED' and stores the output URL.

Effective configuration management is crucial for deployment, scalability, and maintainability across various environments (development, staging, production).\n\n### 1. Key Configuration Areas\n\nBased on the System Design (T5) and Workflow Designs (T32), the following areas require configuration management:\n\n*   **API Gateway (Kong):**\n    *   Service discovery endpoints.\n    *   Authentication provider details (e.g., JWT secret key).\n    *   Rate limiting policies.\n    *   Plugin configurations.\n    *   Upstream service addresses.\n*   **Core Microservices (e.g., Geometry, Scene, Rendering, Material, Animation):**\n    *   Database connection strings (primary DB, potentially read replicas).\n    *   Object storage (S3) credentials and bucket names.\n    *   Message Queue connection details (broker address, queue names, credentials).\n    *   Logging levels and destinations.\n    *   Service-specific parameters (e.g., rendering engine paths, model processing thresholds).\n    *   Internal communication settings (e.g., gRPC endpoints).\n*   **Worker Services (Data Validator, Rendering Worker, etc.):**\n    *   Message Queue connection details.\n    *   Database connection strings.\n    *   Object storage credentials.\n    *   Processing-specific parameters (e.g., number of concurrent tasks, retry attempts).\n*   **Database:**\n    *   Connection pooling settings.\n    *   Replication/failover configurations.\n*   **Object Storage (S3):\n    *   Region, endpoint (if self-hosted).\n*   **Kubernetes Cluster:**\n    *   Resource limits and requests for pods.\n    *   Ingress controller settings.\n    *   Network policies.\n\n### 2. Configuration Management Strategy\n\nA hybrid approach will be adopted, leveraging Kubernetes' native capabilities and external configuration management tools where appropriate.\n\n*   **Environment Variables:** Used for sensitive information (credentials, API keys) and basic settings that are environment-specific. These will be injected into containers via Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps.\n*   **Kubernetes ConfigMaps:** Store non-sensitive configuration data (e.g., service URLs, feature flags, logging levels) in ConfigMaps. Each microservice will mount specific ConfigMaps as files or environment variables.\n*   **Kubernetes Secrets:** Store sensitive configuration data (e.g., database passwords, S3 access keys, JWT secrets).

Effective configuration management is crucial for deployment, scalability, and maintainability across various environments (development, staging, production).\n\n### 1. Key Configuration Areas\n\nBased on the System Design (T5) and Workflow Designs (T32), the following areas require configuration management:\n\n*   **API Gateway (Kong):**\n    *   Service discovery endpoints.\n    *   Authentication provider details (e.g., JWT secret key).\n    *   Rate limiting policies.\n    *   Plugin configurations.\n    *   Upstream service addresses.\n*   **Core Microservices (e.g., Geometry, Scene, Rendering, Material, Animation):**\n    *   Database connection strings (primary DB, potentially read replicas).\n    *   Object storage (S3) credentials and bucket names.\n    *   Message Queue connection details (broker address, queue names, credentials).\n    *   Logging levels and destinations.\n    *   Service-specific parameters (e.g., rendering engine paths, model processing thresholds).\n    *   Internal communication settings (e.g., gRPC endpoints).\n*   **Worker Services (Data Validator, Rendering Worker, etc.):**\n    *   Message Queue connection details.\n    *   Database connection strings.\n    *   Object storage credentials.\n    *   Processing-specific parameters (e.g., number of concurrent tasks, retry attempts).\n*   **Database:**\n    *   Connection pooling settings.\n    *   Replication/failover configurations.\n*   **Object Storage (S3):\n    *   Region, endpoint (if self-hosted).\n*   **Kubernetes Cluster:**\n    *   Resource limits and requests for pods.\n    *   Ingress controller settings.\n    *   Network policies.\n\n### 2. Configuration Management Strategy\n\nA hybrid approach will be adopted, leveraging Kubernetes' native capabilities and external configuration management tools where appropriate.\n\n*   **Environment Variables:** Used for sensitive information (credentials, API keys) and basic settings that are environment-specific. These will be injected into containers via Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps.\n*   **Kubernetes ConfigMaps:** Store non-sensitive configuration data (e.g., service URLs, feature flags, logging levels) in ConfigMaps. Each microservice will mount specific ConfigMaps as files or environment variables.\n*   **Kubernetes Secrets:** Store sensitive configuration data (e.g., database passwords, S3 access keys, JWT secrets). These will be mounted as environment variables or files.\n*   **External Configuration Server (Optional, for advanced needs):** For more complex scenarios or dynamic configuration updates across many services, consider using a dedicated configuration server like HashiCorp Consul or Spring Cloud Config. This would allow for centralized management and dynamic reloads without redeploying services.\n*   **Declarative Configuration (Infrastructure as Code):** All Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets) will be managed using Infrastructure as Code principles (e.g., YAML files stored in version control). This ensures reproducibility and traceability.\n\n### 3.
