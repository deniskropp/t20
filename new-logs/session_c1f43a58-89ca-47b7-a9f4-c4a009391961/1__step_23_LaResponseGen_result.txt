  "reasoning": "The sub-task is to 'Develop response generation strategies for the 3D API.' I have received the system design (from T5) and the linguistic mappings (from T9). The system design outlines the technical architecture and API endpoints, while the linguistic mappings detail how natural language inputs translate to API calls. To develop response generation strategies, I need to consider how the API will communicate back to the user or calling system. This involves defining standard response formats, error handling mechanisms, and how to provide meaningful feedback for both successful operations and failures. I will leverage the defined API endpoints and the expected outcomes of operations to formulate these strategies. The output will be a document detailing these strategies, ensuring that the API's responses are clear, informative, and consistent.",
  "output": "## 3D API: Response Generation Strategies\n\nThis document outlines the strategies for generating responses from the 3D API. The goal is to ensure that responses are consistent, informative, and facilitate effective communication between the API and its clients, whether they are human users interacting via a natural language interface or programmatic clients.\n\n### 1. Standard Response Formats\n\nAll successful API responses will adhere to a consistent JSON structure. This promotes predictability and simplifies client-side parsing.\n\n**1.1. Success Responses:**\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"message\": \"Operation completed successfully.\",\n      \"data\": { ... } // Optional: Contains the requested data or results of the operation.\n    }\n    ```\n*   **`status`:** Always \"success\" for a successful operation.\n*   **`message`:** A brief, human-readable confirmation message (e.g., \"Asset uploaded successfully.\", \"Scene created.\").\n*   **`data`:** This field will contain the primary payload of the response. Its structure will vary depending on the endpoint and the operation performed:\n    *   For `GET` requests returning a single resource: The resource object itself.\n    *   For `GET` requests returning a list: An array of resource objects, potentially with pagination metadata.\n    *   For `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT` requests: May contain the created/updated resource, its ID, or a confirmation of the action.\n    *   For asynchronous operations (e.g., rendering): May contain a job ID and status.\n\n**1.2. Error Responses:**\n\nError responses will also follow a standardized JSON format to provide clear information about what went wrong.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"error\",\n      \"error\": {\n        \"code\": \"API_ERROR_CODE\",\n        \"message\": \"A human-readable error message.\",\n        \"details\": { ... } // Optional: More specific details about the error.\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n*   **`status`:** Always \"error\" for an error condition.\n*   **`error`:** An object containing error details:\n    *   **`code`:** A machine-readable error code (e.g., `INVALID_INPUT`, `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`, `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`). These codes should be documented in the API specification.\n    *   **`message`:** A clear, concise explanation of the error, suitable for developers.\n    *   **`details`:** An optional object providing more granular information, such as validation errors for specific fields (e.g., `{ \"field\": \"email\", \"issue\": \"must be a valid email address\" }`).\n\n### 2. HTTP Status Codes\n\nIn addition to the JSON response body, appropriate HTTP status codes will be used to indicate the outcome of the request:\n\n*   **`200 OK`:** For successful `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH` requests.\n*   **`201 Created`:** For successful `POST` requests that result in resource creation.\n*   **`202 Accepted`:** For asynchronous operations initiated successfully (e.g., submitting a render job).\n*   **`204 No Content`:** For successful requests where no response body is needed (e.g., a `DELETE` operation).\n*   **`400 Bad Request`:** For client-side errors, such as invalid input or malformed requests.\n*   **`401 Unauthorized`:** When authentication is required but has failed or not been provided.\n*   **`403 Forbidden`:** When the user is authenticated but does not have permission to perform the action.\n*   **`404 Not Found`:** When the requested resource does not exist.\n*   **`409 Conflict`:** When the request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource (e.g., trying to create a resource that already exists with the same identifier).\n*   **`500 Internal Server Error`:** For unexpected server-side errors.\n*   **`503 Service Unavailable`:** When the server is temporarily unable to handle the request (e.g., due to maintenance or overload).\n\n### 3. Response Strategies Based on Operation Type\n\n**3.1. Data Retrieval (`GET`):**\n\n*   **Success:** Return the requested data in the `data` field with a `200 OK` status. Include pagination metadata if applicable.\n*   **Error:** Return `404 Not Found` if the resource doesn't exist, or `400 Bad Request` for invalid query parameters. Use the standard error JSON format.\n\n**3.2. Data Creation (`POST`):**\n\n*   **Success:** Return the created resource (or its identifier) in the `data` field with a `201 Created` status. Include a confirmation message.\n*   **Error:** Return `400 Bad Request` for validation errors. Use the standard error JSON format with detailed validation issues.\n\n**3.3. Data Updates (`PUT`, `PATCH`):**\n\n*   **Success:** Return the updated resource (or confirmation) in the `data` field with `200 OK`. A `204 No Content` may be used if no body is returned.\n*   **Error:** Return `404 Not Found` if the resource doesn't exist, or `400 Bad Request` for validation errors. Use the standard error JSON format.\n\n**3.4. Data Deletion (`DELETE`):**\n\n*   **Success:** Return `204 No Content` with an empty body.\n*   **Error:** Return `404 Not Found` if the resource doesn't exist.\n\n**3.5. Asynchronous Operations (e.g., Rendering):**\n\n*   **Initiation Success:** Return a `202 Accepted` status. The `data` field should contain a `job_id` and a link to check the job status (e.g., `\"status_url\": \"/renderjobs/{job_id}/status\"`).\n*   **Status Check Success:** Return `200 OK`. The `data` field will contain the current `status` (e.g., `\"pending\"`, `\"processing\"`, `\"completed\"`, `\"failed\"`) and potentially the output URL if completed.\n*   **Failure:** Return `200 OK` with status `\"failed\"` and include error details in the `error` object within the response, or return an appropriate HTTP error code (e.g., `500`) if the failure is severe.\n\n### 4. Feedback Generation for Natural Language Interaction\n\nResponses should be tailored to provide feedback that aligns with the linguistic mappings defined (T9).\n\n*   **Confirmation:** When a user command is successfully executed, provide a natural language confirmation that mirrors the user's intent (e.g., if the user said \"Create a scene named 'my_scene'\", the API response message could be \"Scene 'my_scene' created successfully.\").\n*   **Error Reporting:** Translate API error codes and messages into user-friendly language. For example, instead of returning `INVALID_INPUT` for a malformed transform, the message could be \"The provided transformation data is incorrect. Please check the format and values.\"\n*   **Progress Updates:** For long-running operations, provide intermediate status updates that can be relayed to the user (e.g., \"Rendering is 50% complete.\").\n\n### 5. Consistency and Documentation\n\n*   All response structures, error codes, and status messages must be meticulously documented in the OpenAPI specification.\n*   Regular reviews of response patterns will be conducted to ensure adherence to these strategies and to adapt them based on user feedback and evolving requirements.\n\nBy implementing these response generation strategies, the 3D API will provide a robust, predictable, and user-friendly interface.",
