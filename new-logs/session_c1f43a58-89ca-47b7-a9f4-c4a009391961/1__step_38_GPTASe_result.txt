{"reasoning": "The user wants to identify and extract Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) specifically for integration, QA, and ongoing support. I have received outputs from the System Integrator (T34), Quality Assurance Specialist (T35), and Theoretical Advisor (T36). These outputs provide context on the state of integration, the QA plan, and theoretical guidance, respectively. My task is to distill these into abstract, domain-agnostic steps that represent the core activities involved in these phases. I will analyze the provided artifacts to identify common, reusable actions related to ensuring the system works together, is of high quality, and is theoretically sound as it evolves.", "output":
