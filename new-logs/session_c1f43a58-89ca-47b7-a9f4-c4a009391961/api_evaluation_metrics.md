## 3D API: Metrics for Evaluation

This document outlines the key metrics for evaluating the performance, usability, and quality of the 3D API. These metrics are derived from the defined requirements (T2) and guided by the system design (T5).

### 1. Performance Metrics

These metrics measure the speed, efficiency, and responsiveness of the API.

*   **Latency:**
    *   **Description:** Time taken for the API to respond to a request.
    *   **Measurement:** Average, P95, and P99 response times for key endpoints (e.g., model upload, scene retrieval, render job submission).
    *   **Target (from NFR2.1.1):** < 500ms for typical operations.
*   **Throughput:**
    *   **Description:** Number of requests the API can handle per unit of time.
    *   **Measurement:** Requests per second (RPS) under various load conditions.
    *   **Target:** To be determined based on expected load and scalability targets (NFR2.2.2).
*   **Resource Utilization:**
    *   **Description:** CPU, memory, and network bandwidth consumed by API services.
    *   **Measurement:** Monitor resource usage of containers/services.
    *   **Target:** Maintain within acceptable limits to ensure scalability and cost-efficiency.
*   **Model Loading Time:**
    *   **Description:** Time taken to load and parse different 3D model formats.
    *   **Measurement:** Average time to load models of varying complexity and size.
    *   **Target:** Efficient handling of large models (NFR2.1.3).
*   **Rendering Time:**
    *   **Description:** Time taken to generate a 2D representation of a 3D scene.
    *   **Measurement:** Time per frame or per render job, varying by scene complexity and rendering settings.
    *   **Target:** Optimized for efficiency (NFR2.1.2).

### 2. Usability Metrics

These metrics assess how easy and intuitive the API is to use for developers and end-users.

*   **API Discoverability:**
    *   **Description:** Ease with which developers can find and understand API functionalities.
    *   **Measurement:** Quality and completeness of API documentation (NFR2.7.2), availability of SDKs or client libraries.
    *   **Target:** Comprehensive, accurate, and easily accessible documentation.
*   **Ease of Integration:**
    *   **Description:** Effort required for developers to integrate the API into their applications.
    *   **Measurement:** Time-to-first-API-call, complexity of authentication and request handling, feedback from beta testers/early adopters.
    *   **Target:** Clear and consistent interfaces (NFR2.7.1).
*   **Error Message Clarity:**
    *   **Description:** Understandability and helpfulness of error messages returned by the API.
    *   **Measurement:** Qualitative review of error messages, user feedback on error handling.
    *   **Target:** Actionable and informative error messages.
*   **Learning Curve:**
    *   **Description:** Time and effort required for a new developer to become proficient with the API.
    *   **Measurement:** Surveys, user testing, analysis of support requests.
    *   **Target:** Minimize learning curve through intuitive design and good documentation.

### 3. Quality Metrics

These metrics evaluate the reliability, correctness, and overall quality of the API's output and functionality.

*   **Availability / Uptime:**
    *   **Description:** Percentage of time the API is operational and accessible.
    *   **Measurement:** Monitoring uptime using external probes and internal service health checks.
    *   **Target (from NFR2.3.1):** 99.9% uptime.
*   **Error Rate:**
    *   **Description:** Percentage of requests that result in an error (server-side errors).
    *   **Measurement:** Track HTTP 5xx errors and specific application-level error codes.
    *   **Target:** As low as practically possible, below industry standards for similar services.
*   **Data Accuracy / Integrity:**
    *   **Description:** Correctness and consistency of the 3D data processed and returned by the API.
    *   **Measurement:** Validation checks against known ground truth, consistency checks for transformations and operations, adherence to standards (NFR2.5.1).
    *   **Target:** High accuracy and integrity for all data operations.
*   **Security Vulnerability Count:**
    *   **Description:** Number of identified security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Measurement:** Results from security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability scans.
    *   **Target:** Zero critical or high-severity vulnerabilities.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**
    *   **Description:** API's ability to continue operating despite component failures.
    *   **Measurement:** Results from chaos engineering tests, analysis of system behavior during simulated failures.
    *   **Target:** Graceful degradation or recovery (NFR2.3.2).
*   **Extensibility:**
    *   **Description:** Ease of adding new features or supporting new formats.
    *   **Measurement:** Time and effort required to implement a new file format parser or a new core service function.
    *   **Target:** Facilitate additions with minimal impact (NFR2.4.1).
*   **Code Quality:**
    *   **Description:** Maintainability, readability, and adherence to standards of the codebase.
    *   **Measurement:** Code reviews, static analysis tool reports, cyclomatic complexity.
    *   **Target:** Adherence to established coding standards (NFR2.8.1).

These metrics will be tracked throughout the development lifecycle and post-deployment to ensure the 3D API meets its performance, usability, and quality objectives.
