    "reasoning": "The initial step is to define the core roles and responsibilities within the team to establish a clear structure for developing the 3D API. This involves assigning specific roles to each team member based on their implied expertise and the overall goal. The subsequent tasks will focus on breaking down the high-level goal into actionable steps, starting with foundational elements like requirements analysis and system design, and progressively moving towards more specialized areas such as data engineering, model tuning, and feedback processing. The iterative nature of the plan allows for refinement and adaptation as the project progresses.",
