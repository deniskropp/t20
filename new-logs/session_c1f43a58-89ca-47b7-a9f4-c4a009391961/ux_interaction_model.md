## 3D API: User Experience and Interaction Model Design

This document outlines the user experience (UX) and interaction model design for the 3D API, drawing upon the defined functional and non-functional requirements (T2) and the conceptual model (T4). The primary goal is to create an API that is intuitive, efficient, and developer-friendly for users working with 3D data.

### 1. Target Users and Use Cases

*   **Primary Users:** 3D artists, game developers, AR/VR developers, CAD engineers, visualization specialists.
*   **Key Use Cases:** 
    *   Loading and manipulating 3D models.
    *   Assembling and managing complex 3D scenes.
    *   Applying materials and textures.
    *   Animating objects.
    *   Generating rendered images or sequences from scenes.
    *   Integrating 3D assets into applications and workflows.

### 2. UX Principles

*   **Simplicity and Intuitiveness:** The API should be easy to understand and use, with a clear and consistent structure.
*   **Discoverability:** Users should be able to easily find and understand the available functionalities and how to use them.
*   **Efficiency:** Operations should be performant, and common workflows should be streamlined.
*   **Feedback and Clarity:** The API should provide clear feedback on operations, including status updates for asynchronous tasks and informative error messages.
*   **Developer Experience (DX):** Comprehensive documentation, clear examples, and predictable behavior are crucial.

### 3. Interaction Model

The interaction model will primarily be based on a RESTful API architecture, leveraging standard HTTP methods and JSON-based request/response bodies. Asynchronous operations will be supported for computationally intensive tasks.

**3.1. Core Resource Representation:**

*   The API will expose resources corresponding to the core abstractions defined in the conceptual model (T4): `Asset`, `Model`, `Material`, `Scene`, `RenderJob`, etc.
*   Each resource will have a unique identifier (e.g., UUID) and a defined schema for its representation (likely JSON).
*   **Example:** A request to retrieve a model might look like:
    ```http
    GET /api/v1/models/{model_id}
    ```
    The response would be a JSON object representing the `ModelResource`.

**3.2. CRUD Operations:**

*   Standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations will be supported for manageable resources like `Assets`, `Materials`, and `Scenes`.
*   **Create:** `POST` requests (e.g., `POST /api/v1/models` for uploading a model).
*   **Read:** `GET` requests (e.g., `GET /api/v1/scenes/{scene_id}`).
*   **Update:** `PUT` or `PATCH` requests (e.g., `PATCH /api/v1/materials/{material_id}`).
*   **Delete:** `DELETE` requests (e.g., `DELETE /api/v1/assets/{asset_id}`).

**3.3. Asynchronous Operations (e.g., Rendering):**

*   For long-running tasks like rendering, an asynchronous pattern will be employed:
    1.  **Initiation:** A `POST` request to trigger the operation (e.g., `POST /api/v1/render_jobs`) with the necessary configuration (`RenderConfiguration`).
    2.  **Response:** The API immediately returns a `RenderJob` resource with a status of `QUEUED` and a unique `job_id`.
    3.  **Status Tracking:** Clients poll a `GET` endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/render_jobs/{job_id}`) to track the job's progress (`QUEUED`, `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`).
    4.  **Result Retrieval:** Upon completion, the `RenderJob` resource will contain a link or reference to the output asset.

**3.4. Data Formats:**

*   **Requests:** Primarily JSON for structured data (e.g., scene definitions, material parameters).
*   **File Uploads:** Support for standard 3D file formats (glTF, OBJ, FBX, USDZ) via `multipart/form-data`.
*   **Responses:** JSON for resource representations and status information. Binary data (e.g., rendered images) will be returned with appropriate `Content-Type` headers.

### 4. Key Interaction Patterns & Flows

*   **Model Upload and Usage:** User uploads a model (`POST /api/v1/assets`), receives an `asset_id`. This `asset_id` is then used when defining a `Scene` or applying it to a `SceneNode`.
*   **Scene Creation and Rendering:** User defines a scene by referencing `asset_id`s for models and materials (`POST /api/v1/scenes`). User then initiates a render job (`POST /api/v1/render_jobs`) specifying the `scene_id` and `RenderConfiguration`. User polls for job status and retrieves the rendered output.
*   **Material Application:** User creates or retrieves a `MaterialDefinition`, then associates it with a `SceneNode` within a `SceneDescription`.

### 5. Usability and Developer Experience Considerations

*   **Clear API Documentation:** Comprehensive, searchable documentation with examples for all endpoints and core concepts is paramount. This aligns with NFR2.7.2.
*   **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Use clear and predictable names for endpoints, parameters, and resource fields.
*   **Informative Error Messages:** Provide detailed error messages that explain the cause of failure and suggest possible solutions, aligning with NFR2.8.2.
*   **SDKs (Optional but Recommended):** Consider providing client SDKs in popular languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) to abstract away HTTP calls and simplify integration.
*   **Versioning:** Implement API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`) to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility.
*   **Rate Limiting Feedback:** Clearly communicate rate limits and provide appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) when limits are exceeded (FR1.3.4).

### 6. Future Considerations

*   **Real-time Collaboration Features:** If applicable, explore WebSockets for real-time updates.
*   **Interactive Previews:** Potentially offer endpoints for generating low-resolution previews or thumbnails.

This design focuses on providing a robust yet accessible interface for interacting with 3D data, balancing the need for powerful features with ease of use for developers.
