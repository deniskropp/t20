## 3D API: High-Level Architecture and Core Components

This document outlines the proposed high-level architecture and core components for the 3D API. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and extensible, catering to a wide range of 3D data processing and rendering needs.

### Architectural Overview

The 3D API will follow a microservices-based architecture, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual components. A central API Gateway will manage incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate backend services. Asynchronous communication will be employed for long-running operations using a message queue.

### Core Components

1.  **API Gateway:**
    *   **Purpose:** Entry point for all client requests. Handles request routing, authentication, rate limiting, and basic request validation.
    *   **Technologies:** e.g., Kong, Traefik, AWS API Gateway.

2.  **Core Services:**
    *   **Geometry Service:** Handles 3D model loading, parsing, validation, and manipulation (e.g., mesh operations, transformations). Supports various file formats (glTF, OBJ, FBX, etc.).
    *   **Scene Management Service:** Manages the organization and composition of 3D scenes, including object hierarchies, materials, lights, and cameras.
    *   **Rendering Service:** Responsible for generating 2D representations (images, videos) of 3D scenes. May support different rendering backends (e.g., rasterization, ray tracing).
    *   **Material & Texture Service:** Manages material definitions, texture loading, and processing (e.g., PBR materials, texture compression).
    *   **Animation Service:** Handles skeletal animation, morph targets, and other animation data processing.

3.  **Data Management:**
    *   **Asset Storage:** A robust storage solution for 3D models, textures, and other assets (e.g., S3-compatible object storage).
    *   **Database:** Stores metadata, scene configurations, user data, and API-specific information (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

4.  **Asynchronous Processing:**
    *   **Message Queue:** Facilitates communication between services for background tasks like complex rendering jobs or model conversions (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS).
    *   **Worker Services:** Processes tasks from the message queue (e.g., Rendering Workers, Conversion Workers).

5.  **Supporting Services:**
    *   **Authentication & Authorization Service:** Manages user authentication and permissions.
    *   **Logging & Monitoring Service:** Collects logs and metrics for system health and performance analysis.

### Data Flow Example (Model Upload & Render):

1.  Client uploads a 3D model via the API Gateway.
2.  API Gateway authenticates the request and routes it to the Geometry Service.
3.  Geometry Service validates and stores the model in Asset Storage.
4.  Geometry Service publishes a 'model_processed' event to the Message Queue.
5.  A Rendering Worker picks up the event, fetches the model, and potentially a scene configuration.
6.  Rendering Worker uses the Rendering Service to generate an image and stores it in Asset Storage.
7.  Rendering Worker publishes a 'render_complete' event.
8.  API Gateway notifies the client of the completed render job.

### Key Considerations:

*   **Scalability:** Each service should be independently scalable.
*   **Extensibility:** The architecture should allow for easy addition of new services and features.
*   **Interoperability:** Adherence to common 3D standards (glTF) is crucial.
*   **Performance:** Optimization for efficient data processing and rendering.
