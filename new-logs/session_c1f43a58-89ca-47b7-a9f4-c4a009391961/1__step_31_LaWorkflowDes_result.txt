  "reasoning": "The sub-task is to 'Design and optimize workflows for API operations and data processing.' I have received the System Design document (T5) and the Data Ingestion and Management Plan (T13). Both documents provide foundational information about the API's architecture, data handling, and processing needs. My role as a Workflow Designer (T32) requires me to take this information and define specific workflows for key API operations and data processing tasks. I will focus on outlining the steps, components involved, and the flow of data for critical operations like asset ingestion, scene creation, and rendering. This will involve detailing how asynchronous processing and inter-service communication will be orchestrated.",
  "output": "## Workflow Designs for 3D API Operations and Data Processing\n\nThis document outlines the designed workflows for key API operations and data processing tasks, building upon the System Design (T5) and Data Ingestion/Management Plan (T13). These workflows aim to ensure efficient, scalable, and reliable execution of core functionalities.\n\n### 1. Asset Ingestion Workflow\n\nThis workflow covers the process from receiving an asset file to its storage and validation.\n\n*   **Trigger:** `POST /v1/assets/upload` request or batch ingestion process.\n*   **Actors:** API Gateway, Geometry Service, Asset Storage (S3), Database, Data Validator Service, Message Queue.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  **Request Reception:** API Gateway receives the upload request (file + metadata).\n    2.  **Initial Validation:** API Gateway performs authentication and basic request validation.\n    3.  **File Handling:** Request forwarded to Geometry Service. Service performs initial file checks (type, size) and generates a unique asset ID.\n    4.  **Storage:** Geometry Service uploads the raw asset file to AWS S3. The S3 path and initial metadata are stored in the Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB), associated with the asset ID.\n    5.  **Asynchronous Validation Trigger:** Geometry Service publishes a `asset_validated` message to the Message Queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) with the asset ID.\n    6.  **Data Validation:** A worker instance of the Data Validator Service consumes the message.\n    7.  **Content Validation:** Data Validator Service performs in-depth validation of the asset's geometry, materials, and textures. It may invoke specific parsing or analysis tools.\n    8.  **Status Update:** Data Validator Service updates the asset's status in the Database (e.g., 'VALIDATED', 'FAILED'). If validation fails, it logs the error details.\n    9.  **Optional Conversion:** If format conversion is required, the Data Validator Service publishes a `convert_asset` message to the Message Queue, triggering a conversion worker.\n    10. **Completion Notification:** Upon successful validation (and optional conversion), the Data Validator Service can publish a `asset_ready` message for downstream services.\n*   **Optimization Notes:** Utilize S3 multipart uploads for large files. Implement efficient metadata extraction. Scale Data Validator workers based on queue depth.\n\n### 2. Scene Creation/Update Workflow\n\nThis workflow handles the creation and modification of scene definitions.\n\n*   **Trigger:** `POST /v1/scenes` or `PUT /v1/scenes/{scene_id}` request.\n*   **Actors:** API Gateway, Scene Management Service, Database.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  **Request Reception:** API Gateway receives the scene definition (JSON payload referencing asset IDs, transformations, etc.).\n    2.  **Authentication & Authorization:** API Gateway authenticates the user and performs basic authorization checks.\n    3.  **Scene Processing:** Request forwarded to Scene Management Service.\n    4.  **Asset Reference Validation:** Scene Management Service optionally checks if referenced asset IDs exist and are accessible (by querying the Database or Asset Metadata service).\n    5.  **Database Operation:** Scene Management Service performs the `CREATE` or `UPDATE` operation on the scene data in the Database.\n    6.  **Response:** Scene Management Service returns the scene ID and status to the API Gateway, which relays it to the client.\n*   **Optimization Notes:** Ensure efficient database indexing for scene queries. Cache frequently accessed scene data if applicable.\n\n### 3. Render Job Submission Workflow\n\nThis workflow manages the process of submitting and queuing rendering tasks.\n\n*   **Trigger:** `POST /v1/renderjobs` request.\n*   **Actors:** API Gateway, Rendering Service, Scene Management Service, Database, Message Queue.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  **Request Reception:** API Gateway receives the render job request (scene ID, camera configuration, output settings).\n    2.  **Authentication & Authorization:** API Gateway handles authentication and authorization.\n    3.  **Scene Retrieval:** Request forwarded to Rendering Service, which then requests scene data from the Scene Management Service (or directly from the Database).\n    4.  **Render Job Creation:** Rendering Service creates a new `RenderJob` entry in the Database with 'PENDING' status.\n    5.  **Job Queuing:** Rendering Service publishes a `render_job_submitted` message to the Message Queue, including the `job_id` and relevant scene/camera details.\n    6.  **Response:** Rendering Service returns the `job_id` to the API Gateway, which relays it to the client.\n*   **Optimization Notes:** Implement robust job prioritization in the message queue if needed. Provide clear feedback to the client on job submission status.\n\n### 4. Rendering Execution Workflow (Worker)\n\nThis workflow describes the process executed by rendering worker instances.\n\n*   **Trigger:** Consumption of `render_job_submitted` message from the Message Queue.\n*   **Actors:** Rendering Worker, Asset Storage (S3), Database, Rendering Engine.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  **Job Consumption:** Rendering Worker picks up a `render_job_submitted` message.\n    2.  **Status Update:** Worker updates the `RenderJob` status in the Database to 'PROCESSING'.\n    3.  **Asset Fetching:** Worker retrieves necessary scene data and asset files (models, textures) from S3 based on the scene information.\n    4.  **Rendering Execution:** Worker utilizes the Rendering Engine to perform the rendering based on the job parameters (camera, resolution, etc.).\n    5.  **Output Storage:** Rendered output is uploaded to S3.\n    6.  **Database Update:** Worker updates the `RenderJob` status in the Database to 'COMPLETED' and stores the output URL. If an error occurs, the status is updated to 'FAILED' with error details.\n    7.  **Completion Notification (Optional):** Worker can publish a `render_job_completed` message for post-processing or client notifications.\n*   **Optimization Notes:** Utilize efficient asset caching on worker nodes. Optimize rendering engine parameters. Implement health checks and automatic restarts for workers.\n\n### 5. Data Processing/Transformation Workflow (General)\n\nThis is a general template for asynchronous data processing tasks (e.g., format conversion, optimization).\n\n*   **Trigger:** Message published to a specific processing queue (e.g., `convert_asset`, `optimize_mesh`).\n*   **Actors:** Processing Worker, Database, Asset Storage (S3), specific processing tools/libraries.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  **Job Consumption:** Worker consumes message containing task details (e.g., asset ID, source path, target format).\n    2.  **Status Update:** Update associated record in Database to 'PROCESSING'.\n    3.  **Data Fetching:** Retrieve source data from S3.\n    4.  **Processing:** Execute the required processing task (e.g., convert format, optimize mesh).\n    5.  **Output Storage:** Store processed data in S3 (potentially with a new asset ID or version).\n    6.  **Database Update:** Update record with new location/status. Log any errors.\n    7.  **Downstream Notification:** Publish a message indicating task completion/failure for further actions.\n*   **Optimization Notes:** Design workers to be stateless and horizontally scalable. Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures. Monitor processing times and resource utilization.\n\nThese workflows provide a structured approach to API operations and data processing, emphasizing asynchronous execution, service decoupling, and robust error handling, aligning with the overall system design and data management strategy.",
