  "reasoning": "The user has requested the implementation of initial data ingestion pipelines as the specific sub-task. The `Data Engineer`'s output (T13) provides a comprehensive plan for data ingestion and management, which is a prerequisite for this task. My role as `Ingestion Specialist` (T18) is to now implement the initial data ingestion pipelines based on this plan. This involves defining the core components and steps for ingesting data, focusing on the direct upload API endpoint and the initial validation steps. I will create a markdown file outlining these initial pipelines, including the API endpoint, the validation checks, and the interaction with storage and messaging systems as described in the plan.",
  "output": "## Implementation Plan: Initial Data Ingestion Pipelines\n\nThis document outlines the implementation of the initial data ingestion pipelines for the 3D API, building upon the `Plan for Data Ingestion and Management` (T13).\n\n### 1. Direct Upload API Endpoint (`/v1/assets/upload`)\n\nThis endpoint will serve as the primary mechanism for direct asset uploads.\n\n*   **Technology Stack:** To be implemented using the chosen API Gateway and a dedicated microservice (e.g., Geometry Service).\n*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`\n*   **Request:**\n    *   **Headers:** `Content-Type` (e.g., `multipart/form-data`), `Authorization` (for authentication).\n    *   **Body:** The asset file itself (e.g., glTF, OBJ, PNG) and any associated metadata as form fields.\n*   **Functionality:**\n    1.  **Authentication & Authorization:** Verify the user's credentials and permissions.\n    2.  **File Reception:** Receive the uploaded file and metadata.\n    3.  **Basic Validation (Initial Ingestion - T18):\n        *   **File Type Check:** Verify the uploaded file's extension and/or MIME type against a list of supported formats (e.g., `.gltf`, `.glb`, `.obj`, `.fbx`, `.png`, `.jpg`).\n        *   **File Size Check:** Enforce a maximum file size limit to prevent abuse and manage resources.\n        *   **Metadata Presence:** Ensure essential metadata fields (if any are required at this stage) are present.\n    4.  **Temporary Storage:** Store the uploaded file temporarily.\n    5.  **Orchestration:** Initiate the next steps in the ingestion pipeline:\n        *   Publish a message to the message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) containing the file location and initial metadata.\n        *   Return a `202 Accepted` response to the client, indicating that the upload has been received and processing has begun, along with an asset ID or tracking identifier.\n*   **Error Handling:** Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `400 Bad Request` for validation errors, `413 Payload Too Large`, `500 Internal Server Error` for processing failures).\n\n### 2. Initial Validation Service/Module\n\nThis component will be responsible for performing the initial checks on uploaded assets.\n\n*   **Responsibilities:**\n    *   Execute the validation rules defined in step 1.3.\n    *   If validation fails, generate an error response and log the failure.\n    *   If validation passes, prepare the asset for the next stage (e.g., uploading to S3).\n*   **Implementation Details:** This can be a dedicated microservice or a module within the Geometry Service.\n\n### 3. Message Queue Integration\n\n*   **Purpose:** Decouple the upload endpoint from the subsequent processing steps, allowing for asynchronous handling and scalability.\n*   **Event:** A new message will be published to a designated queue (e.g., `asset-ingestion-queue`) upon successful initial validation.\n*   **Message Payload:** `{ \"asset_id\": \"<generated_uuid>\", \"original_filename\": \"...\", \"file_path\": \"<temporary_storage_path>\", \"metadata\": { ... } }`\n\n### 4. Interaction with Storage and Processing\n\n*   **Asset Storage (AWS S3):** The subsequent processing worker (triggered by the message queue) will be responsible for moving the file from temporary storage to its permanent location in S3.\n*   **Database:** Metadata will be initially recorded in the database with a status of 'processing' or similar.\n*   **Background Workers:** These workers will consume messages from the queue to perform more in-depth validation, format conversion, and other processing tasks (as defined in T13 and T19).\n\n### 5. Future Enhancements (Post Initial Implementation)\n\n*   **Batch Ingestion:** Development of scripts and infrastructure for bulk data loading.\n*   **External Source Integration:** Implementing connectors for specific external data sources (T20).\n*   **Advanced Validation:** Integrating more sophisticated checks for 3D model integrity and texture quality.\n\nThis implementation plan focuses on establishing the foundational direct upload pipeline, ensuring that assets can be received, minimally validated, and queued for further processing.",
