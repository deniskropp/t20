  "output": "## 3D API: High-Level Architecture and Core Components\n\nThis document outlines the proposed high-level architecture and core components for the 3D API. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and extensible, catering to a wide range of 3D data processing and rendering needs.\n\n### Architectural Overview\n\nThe 3D API will follow a microservices-based architecture, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual components. A central API Gateway will manage incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate backend services. Asynchronous communication will be employed for long-running operations using a message queue.\n\n### Core Components\n\n1.  **API Gateway:**\n    *   **Purpose:** Entry point for all client requests. Handles request routing, authentication, rate limiting, and basic request validation.\n    *   **Technologies:** e.g., Kong, Traefik, AWS API Gateway.\n\n2.  **Core Services:**\n    *   **Geometry Service:** Handles 3D model loading, parsing, validation, and manipulation (e.g., mesh operations, transformations). Supports various file formats (glTF, OBJ, FBX, etc.).\n    *   **Scene Management Service:** Manages the organization and composition of 3D scenes, including object hierarchies, materials, lights, and cameras.\n    *   **Rendering Service:** Responsible for generating 2D representations (images, videos) of 3D scenes. May support different rendering backends (e.g., rasterization, ray tracing).\n    *   **Material & Texture Service:** Manages material definitions, texture loading, and processing (e.g., PBR materials, texture compression).\n    *   **Animation Service:** Handles skeletal animation, morph targets, and other animation data processing.\n\n3.  **Data Management:**\n    *   **Asset Storage:** A robust storage solution for 3D models, textures, and other assets (e.g., S3-compatible object storage).\n    *   **Database:** Stores metadata, scene configurations, user data, and API-specific information (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).\n\n4.  **Asynchronous Processing:**\n    *   **Message Queue:** Facilitates communication between services for background tasks like complex rendering jobs or model conversions (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS).\n    *   **Worker Services:** Processes tasks from the message queue (e.g., Rendering Workers, Conversion Workers).\n\n5.  **Supporting Services:**\n    *   **Authentication & Authorization Service:** Manages user authentication and permissions.\n    *   **Logging & Monitoring Service:** Collects logs and metrics for system health and performance analysis.\n\n### Data Flow Example (Model Upload & Render):\n\n1.  Client uploads a 3D model via the API Gateway.\n2.  API Gateway authenticates the request and routes it to the Geometry Service.\n3.  Geometry Service validates and stores the model in Asset Storage.\n4.  Geometry Service publishes a 'model_processed' event to the Message Queue.\n5.  A Rendering Worker picks up the event, fetches the model, and potentially a scene configuration.\n6.  Rendering Worker uses the Rendering Service to generate an image and stores it in Asset Storage.\n7.  Rendering Worker publishes a 'render_complete' event.\n8.  API Gateway notifies the client of the completed render job.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n*   **Scalability:** Each service should be independently scalable.\n*   **Extensibility:** The architecture should allow for easy addition of new services and features.\n*   **Interoperability:** Adherence to common 3D standards (glTF) is crucial.\n*   **Performance:** Optimization for efficient data processing and rendering.",
