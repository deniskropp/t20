  "reasoning": "The sub-task is to gather and analyze functional and non-functional requirements for the 3D API. The provided input from the System Architect (T1) gives a high-level overview of the API's architecture and core components. This information is crucial for identifying and detailing the functional requirements (what the API should do) and non-functional requirements (how the API should perform). I will use the architectural components and their described purposes to derive specific requirements. For example, the 'Geometry Service' implies functional requirements related to model loading, parsing, and manipulation, while 'Scalability' and 'Performance' mentioned in the considerations directly translate to non-functional requirements.",
  "output": "## 3D API: Functional and Non-Functional Requirements\n\nThis document details the functional and non-functional requirements for the 3D API, derived from the high-level architecture and core components defined by the System Architect.\n\n### 1. Functional Requirements (FR)\n\nThese requirements define the specific capabilities and features the 3D API must provide.\n\n**1.1. Core Services Functionality:**\n\n*   **FR1.1.1 (Geometry Service):** The API must support loading and parsing of various 3D model file formats (e.g., glTF, OBJ, FBX, USDZ). \n*   **FR1.1.2 (Geometry Service):** The API must provide functionalities for basic 3D model manipulation, including transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), mesh operations (e.g., merging, splitting), and vertex/face manipulation.\n*   **FR1.1.3 (Geometry Service):** The API must validate the integrity and structure of uploaded 3D models.\n*   **FR1.1.4 (Scene Management Service):** The API must allow users to define and manage 3D scenes, including the composition of multiple 3D objects, hierarchical structuring, and scene graph management.\n*   **FR1.1.5 (Scene Management Service):** The API must support the definition and management of scene elements such as cameras (perspective, orthographic) and lights (directional, point, spot).\n*   **FR1.1.6 (Rendering Service):** The API must be able to generate 2D representations (e.g., images, potentially video frames) of 3D scenes based on defined camera views and scene configurations.\n*   **FR1.1.7 (Rendering Service):** The API should support different rendering techniques (e.g., rasterization, ray tracing) and quality settings.\n*   **FR1.1.8 (Material & Texture Service):** The API must support the definition and application of materials, including standard (e.g., PBR) and custom material properties.\n*   **FR1.1.9 (Material & Texture Service):** The API must handle the loading, processing, and application of textures (e.g., diffuse, normal, metallic-roughness maps).\n*   **FR1.1.10 (Animation Service):** The API must support the playback and manipulation of skeletal animations and morph target animations.\n\n**1.2. Data Management Functionality:**\n\n*   **FR1.2.1 (Asset Storage):** The API must provide mechanisms for uploading, storing, and retrieving 3D assets (models, textures, etc.).\n*   **FR1.2.2 (Database):** The API must store and manage metadata associated with 3D assets, scene configurations, user data, and API usage.\n\n**1.3. API Gateway Functionality:**\n\n*   **FR1.3.1 (API Gateway):** The API must provide a unified entry point for all client interactions.\n*   **FR1.3.2 (API Gateway):** The API must handle request routing to the appropriate backend services.\n*   **FR1.3.3 (API Gateway):** The API must implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing its functionalities.\n*   **FR1.3.4 (API Gateway):** The API must support rate limiting to manage request volume.\n\n**1.4. Asynchronous Operations:**\n\n*   **FR1.4.1 (Message Queue/Worker Services):** The API must support asynchronous processing for long-running operations such as complex rendering jobs or model conversions.\n*   **FR1.4.2 (Message Queue/Worker Services):** The API must provide mechanisms for clients to track the status of asynchronous tasks.\n\n### 2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)\n\nThese requirements define the quality attributes and constraints of the 3D API.\n\n**2.1. Performance:**\n\n*   **NFR2.1.1:** The API should provide low latency for standard operations (e.g., model loading, transformations). Target: < 500ms for typical requests.\n*   **NFR2.1.2:** Rendering operations should be optimized for efficiency, with configurable quality/speed trade-offs.\n*   **NFR2.1.3:** The API should efficiently handle large and complex 3D models and scenes.\n\n**2.2. Scalability:**\n\n*   **NFR2.2.1:** The architecture must support horizontal scaling of individual services to handle increasing load.\n*   **NFR2.2.2:** The system should be able to scale to support a large number of concurrent users and requests.\n\n**2.3. Reliability & Availability:**\n\n*   **NFR2.3.1:** The API should aim for high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime).\n*   **NFR2.3.2:** Services should be fault-tolerant, with mechanisms for graceful degradation or recovery.\n\n**2.4. Extensibility:**\n\n*   **NFR2.4.1:** The API design should facilitate the addition of new features, services, and support for new 3D formats with minimal impact on existing functionality.\n\n**2.5. Interoperability & Standards:**\n\n*   **NFR2.5.1:** The API must adhere to relevant industry standards for 3D data representation and exchange (e.g., glTF specification).\n*   **NFR2.5.2:** The API should be designed to integrate with other systems and tools within the 3D ecosystem.\n\n**2.6. Security:**\n\n*   **NFR2.6.1:** All data transmission must be secured (e.g., using HTTPS).\n*   **NFR2.6.2:** Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms must be implemented to protect user data and API access.\n*   **NFR2.6.3:** Input validation must be performed rigorously to prevent security vulnerabilities.\n\n**2.7. Usability:**\n\n*   **NFR2.7.1:** The API should offer clear and consistent interfaces (e.g., RESTful endpoints, well-defined request/response formats).\n*   **NFR2.7.2:** Comprehensive documentation should be provided for all API endpoints and functionalities.\n\n**2.8. Maintainability:**\n\n*   **NFR2.8.1:** Code should be well-structured, commented, and adhere to coding standards.\n*   **NFR2.8.2:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring should be in place to aid in debugging and issue resolution.",
