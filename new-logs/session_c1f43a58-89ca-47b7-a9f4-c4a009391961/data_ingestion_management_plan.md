## Plan for Data Ingestion and Management for the 3D API

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for data ingestion and management for the 3D API, leveraging the architectural decisions and technology stack defined in the initial system design (T5).

### 1. Data Sources and Types

The 3D API will handle various types of data, including:

*   **3D Models:** Geometry data, including meshes, vertices, normals, UV coordinates (e.g., glTF, OBJ, FBX, STL).
*   **Textures and Materials:** Image files (e.g., JPG, PNG), material definitions (e.g., PBR materials).
*   **Scene Descriptions:** Scene graph data, including object hierarchies, transformations, lighting, cameras.
*   **Metadata:** Associated information for assets, such as descriptions, usage rights, creation dates, tags.
*   **User-generated Content:** Potentially user-uploaded models, textures, or scene configurations.

### 2. Data Ingestion Strategy

Data ingestion will be handled through a combination of automated pipelines and direct upload mechanisms.

*   **Direct Upload API Endpoint:**
    *   A dedicated API endpoint (e.g., `POST /v1/assets/upload`) will allow users or systems to directly upload asset files.
    *   The API Gateway will handle initial validation and authentication.
    *   The Geometry Service will receive the file, perform basic validation (file type, size), extract initial metadata, and orchestrate storage.
*   **Batch Ingestion:**
    *   For large-scale or bulk data imports, a batch ingestion process will be established.
    *   This could involve tools like AWS DataSync or custom scripts that read from designated cloud storage locations or network shares.
    *   A message queue will be used to trigger processing for each ingested asset.
*   **External Source Integration:**
    *   As defined by `LaSourceInt` (T20), mechanisms will be built to integrate data from predefined external sources. This may involve ETL processes or API integrations with third-party data providers.

### 3. Data Ingestion Pipeline Workflow

1.  **Upload/Transfer:** Asset file is uploaded via API or transferred via batch process.
2.  **Initial Validation (Ingestion Specialist - T18):** Basic checks on file integrity, format, and size.
3.  **Metadata Extraction:** Extracting essential metadata directly from the file (e.g., vertex count, bounding box from a glTF file).
4.  **Storage (Data Engineer - T13):
    *   **Asset Storage (AWS S3):** The raw asset file will be uploaded to a designated S3 bucket. A unique identifier will be generated for the asset.
    *   **Database Storage (PostgreSQL/MongoDB):** Metadata associated with the asset will be stored in the primary database, including a reference to its location in S3.
5.  **Data Validation (Data Validator - T19):
    *   **Schema Validation:** Ensure metadata conforms to defined schemas.
    *   **Content Validation:** Perform more in-depth checks on the 3D model data itself (e.g., manifold geometry, valid UVs, texture compatibility). This may involve invoking specific processing services.
    *   **Format Conversion (Optional):** If necessary, convert assets to a standardized format (e.g., ensuring all models are in glTF) using background workers triggered via the message queue.
6.  **Indexing & Cataloging:** Ensure the asset and its metadata are properly indexed for efficient querying.
7.  **Notification:** Notify relevant services or users upon successful ingestion or any failures.

### 4. Data Management and Storage

*   **Asset Storage (AWS S3):**
    *   **Structure:** Organize assets logically within S3 (e.g., by type, upload date, project ID).
    *   **Lifecycle Policies:** Implement S3 lifecycle policies for cost optimization (e.g., moving older, less accessed data to cheaper storage tiers or archiving).
    *   **Access Control:** Configure S3 bucket policies for secure access.
*   **Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB):
    *   **Schema Design:** Design flexible and efficient schemas to store asset metadata, scene descriptions, user information, and other relevant data.
    *   **Indexing:** Implement appropriate database indexes to support fast querying of assets based on various criteria (type, tags, creation date, etc.).
    *   **Backups & Recovery:** Establish regular database backup and recovery procedures.
*   **Data Integrity:** Implement checksums or versioning for critical data to ensure integrity and enable rollback if necessary.

### 5. Data Processing and Transformation

*   **Asynchronous Workers:** Utilize background workers (triggered via RabbitMQ/Kafka) for computationally intensive tasks like:
    *   3D model format conversion.
    *   Mesh optimization and simplification.
    *   Texture compression.
    *   Generating thumbnails or preview renders.
*   **Workflow Orchestration (Workflow Designer - T32):** Design and optimize workflows for these processing tasks, ensuring efficient resource utilization and error handling.

### 6. Data Security and Compliance

*   **Access Control:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for managing access to data and API functionalities.
*   **Data Encryption:** Ensure data is encrypted at rest (e.g., S3 server-side encryption) and in transit (HTTPS).
*   **Privacy:** Comply with relevant data privacy regulations if user data is collected or stored.

### 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

*   **Pipeline Monitoring:** Monitor the health and performance of ingestion pipelines, including throughput, error rates, and processing times.
*   **Storage Monitoring:** Track storage utilization and costs.
*   **Data Quality Audits:** Periodically audit data quality and consistency.
*   **Log Management:** Centralized logging for all ingestion and management processes.

This plan provides a roadmap for building a robust and scalable data ingestion and management system for the 3D API.
