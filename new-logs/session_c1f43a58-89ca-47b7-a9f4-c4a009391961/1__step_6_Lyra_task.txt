  "output": "## 3D API: Initial System Design\n\nThis document outlines the initial system design for the 3D API, synthesizing the high-level architecture, functional/non-functional requirements, and core conceptual abstractions. It provides a more detailed blueprint for the development team.\n\n### 1. Architectural Decisions & Technology Stack\n\nBased on the microservices architecture (T1) and requirements (T2), the following technology stack is proposed:\n\n*   **API Gateway:** \n    *   **Technology:** Kong API Gateway.\n    *   **Rationale:** Offers robust features for routing, authentication (JWT, OAuth2), rate limiting, and plugin extensibility. Its declarative configuration supports microservices.\n*   **Core Services (Geometry, Scene, Rendering, Material, Animation):**\n    *   **Language/Framework:** Python (FastAPI/Flask) for rapid development and rich ecosystem, or Go for performance-critical services.\n    *   **Rationale:** Python offers libraries for 3D manipulation (e.g., `trimesh`, `Open3D`) and web frameworks suitable for microservices. Go provides excellent concurrency and performance for compute-intensive tasks like rendering.\n    *   **Containerization:** Docker.\n    *   **Rationale:** Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   **Asset Storage:** AWS S3 or compatible object storage (e.g., MinIO).\n    *   **Rationale:** Scalable, durable, and cost-effective storage for large binary assets like 3D models and textures.\n    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension (for potential spatial queries) or MongoDB.\n    *   **Rationale:** PostgreSQL offers relational integrity and powerful features. MongoDB provides flexibility for evolving metadata schemas.\n*   **Asynchronous Processing:**\n    *   **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or Kafka.\n    *   **Rationale:** Robust message queuing systems for decoupling services and handling background tasks reliably. RabbitMQ is simpler for basic queuing, while Kafka offers higher throughput and stream processing capabilities.\n*   **Inter-service Communication:** RESTful APIs for synchronous requests (e.g., to API Gateway) and gRPC for high-performance internal communication between core services where latency is critical. Asynchronous communication via the Message Queue.\n*   **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes.\n*   **Rationale:** Manages deployment, scaling, and networking of containerized microservices.\n\n### 2. Data Models\n\nBuilding upon the conceptual abstractions (T4), the following data models will guide the implementation:\n\n*   **`Asset` Object:** \n    *   Schema will include `asset_id`, `asset_type`, `file_format`, `storage_path` (in S3), `upload_timestamp`, `metadata` (JSONB field).\n*   **`Model` Representation:** \n    *   Geometry data will be stored efficiently (e.g., binary format, potentially optimized for web delivery like glTF). Metadata will include vertex/triangle counts, bounding boxes.\n*   **`Scene` Object:** \n    *   Will store scene graph structure, references to `Asset` IDs for models, materials, lights, and cameras.

      "content": "## 3D API: Initial System Design\n\nThis document outlines the initial system design for the 3D API, synthesizing the high-level architecture, functional/non-functional requirements, and core conceptual abstractions. It provides a more detailed blueprint for the development team.\n\n### 1. Architectural Decisions & Technology Stack\n\nBased on the microservices architecture (T1) and requirements (T2), the following technology stack is proposed:\n\n*   **API Gateway:** \n    *   **Technology:** Kong API Gateway.\n    *   **Rationale:** Offers robust features for routing, authentication (JWT, OAuth2), rate limiting, and plugin extensibility. Its declarative configuration supports microservices.\n*   **Core Services (Geometry, Scene, Rendering, Material, Animation):**\n    *   **Language/Framework:** Python (FastAPI/Flask) for rapid development and rich ecosystem, or Go for performance-critical services.\n    *   **Rationale:** Python offers libraries for 3D manipulation (e.g., `trimesh`, `Open3D`) and web frameworks suitable for microservices. Go provides excellent concurrency and performance for compute-intensive tasks like rendering.\n    *   **Containerization:** Docker.\n    *   **Rationale:** Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   **Asset Storage:** AWS S3 or compatible object storage (e.g., MinIO).\n    *   **Rationale:** Scalable, durable, and cost-effective storage for large binary assets like 3D models and textures.\n    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension (for potential spatial queries) or MongoDB.\n    *   **Rationale:** PostgreSQL offers relational integrity and powerful features. MongoDB provides flexibility for evolving metadata schemas.\n*   **Asynchronous Processing:**\n    *   **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or Kafka.\n    *   **Rationale:** Robust message queuing systems for decoupling services and handling background tasks reliably. RabbitMQ is simpler for basic queuing, while Kafka offers higher throughput and stream processing capabilities.\n*   **Inter-service Communication:** RESTful APIs for synchronous requests (e.g., to API Gateway) and gRPC for high-performance internal communication between core services where latency is critical. Asynchronous communication via the Message Queue.\n*   **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes.\n*   **Rationale:** Manages deployment, scaling, and networking of containerized microservices.\n\n### 2. Data Models\n\nBuilding upon the conceptual abstractions (T4), the following data models will guide the implementation:\n\n*   **`Asset` Object:** \n    *   Schema will include `asset_id`, `asset_type`, `file_format`, `storage_path` (in S3), `upload_timestamp`, `metadata` (JSONB field).\n*   **`Model` Representation:** \n    *   Geometry data will be stored efficiently (e.g., binary format, potentially optimized for web delivery like glTF). Metadata will include vertex/triangle counts, bounding boxes.\n*   **`Scene` Object:** \n    *   Will store scene graph structure, references to `Asset` IDs for models, materials, lights, and cameras. Stored in the primary database.\n*   **`RenderJob` Object:**\n    *   Schema will include `job_id`, `scene_id`, `camera_config`, `output_format`, `resolution`, `status` (enum), `created_at`, `completed_at`, `output_path`.\n\n### 3. API Design Considerations\n\n*   **RESTful Principles:** Adhere to RESTful principles for external-facing APIs.\n*   **Versioning:** Implement API versioning (e.g., `/v1/...`).\n*   **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication, managed by the API Gateway.\n*   **Standard Formats:** Prioritize glTF for model exchange due to its web-friendliness and extensibility.\n*   **Error Handling:** Consistent error response format across all endpoints.\n*   **Documentation:** OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for generating interactive documentation.\n\n**Example Endpoints:**\n\n*   `POST /v1/assets/upload`: Upload a new asset.\n*   `GET /v1/assets/{asset_id}`: Retrieve asset metadata.\n*   `POST /v1/scenes`: Create a new scene.\n*   `PUT /v1/scenes/{scene_id}`: Update an existing scene.\n*   `POST /v1/renderjobs`: Submit a new render job.\n*   `GET /v1/renderjobs/{job_id}`: Get render job status and output URL.\n\n### 4.

Fine-grained authorization within services as needed.\n*   **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation at the API Gateway and service levels to prevent malformed data or security exploits.\n*   **Secure Storage:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (HTTPS for all external communication).\n\nThis initial system design provides a concrete foundation for the subsequent development phases. It balances flexibility with the need for a robust and scalable architecture."
