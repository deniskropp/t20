  "reasoning": "The sub-task is to identify and extract Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) for the initial phase of 3D API development. The available inputs are the functional and non-functional requirements (T2) and the initial system design (T5). I will analyze these documents to identify fundamental, abstract actions that are crucial during the initial design and requirements gathering phases of any API development, not just for 3D APIs. These steps should represent reusable problem-solving or design actions.",
