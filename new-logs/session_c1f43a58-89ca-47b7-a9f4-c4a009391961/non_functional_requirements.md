## 3D API: Non-Functional Requirements

These requirements define the quality attributes and constraints of the 3D API.

**2.1. Performance:**

*   **NFR2.1.1:** The API should provide low latency for standard operations (e.g., model loading, transformations). Target: < 500ms for typical requests.
*   **NFR2.1.2:** Rendering operations should be optimized for efficiency, with configurable quality/speed trade-offs.
*   **NFR2.1.3:** The API should efficiently handle large and complex 3D models and scenes.

**2.2. Scalability:**

*   **NFR2.2.1:** The architecture must support horizontal scaling of individual services to handle increasing load.
*   **NFR2.2.2:** The system should be able to scale to support a large number of concurrent users and requests.

**2.3. Reliability & Availability:**

*   **NFR2.3.1:** The API should aim for high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
*   **NFR2.3.2:** Services should be fault-tolerant, with mechanisms for graceful degradation or recovery.

**2.4. Extensibility:**

*   **NFR2.4.1:** The API design should facilitate the addition of new features, services, and support for new 3D formats with minimal impact on existing functionality.

**2.5. Interoperability & Standards:**

*   **NFR2.5.1:** The API must adhere to relevant industry standards for 3D data representation and exchange (e.g., glTF specification).
*   **NFR2.5.2:** The API should be designed to integrate with other systems and tools within the 3D ecosystem.

**2.6. Security:**

*   **NFR2.6.1:** All data transmission must be secured (e.g., using HTTPS).
*   **NFR2.6.2:** Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms must be implemented to protect user data and API access.
*   **NFR2.6.3:** Input validation must be performed rigorously to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**2.7. Usability:**

*   **NFR2.7.1:** The API should offer clear and consistent interfaces (e.g., RESTful endpoints, well-defined request/response formats).
*   **NFR2.7.2:** Comprehensive documentation should be provided for all API endpoints and functionalities.

**2.8. Maintainability:**

*   **NFR2.8.1:** Code should be well-structured, commented, and adhere to coding standards.
*   **NFR2.8.2:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring should be in place to aid in debugging and issue resolution.
