  "reasoning": "The current sub-task is to design the user experience and interaction model for the 3D API. To achieve this, I need to synthesize the information from the requirements analysis (T2) and the conceptual model (T4). The requirements provide constraints and desired functionalities (e.g., ease of use, clear interfaces, documentation), while the conceptual model defines the core entities and abstractions that users will interact with. My output will outline a UX strategy, key interaction patterns, and considerations for usability and developer experience, ensuring the API is intuitive and efficient for its target users.",
  "output": "## 3D API: User Experience and Interaction Model Design\n\nThis document outlines the user experience (UX) and interaction model design for the 3D API, drawing upon the defined functional and non-functional requirements (T2) and the conceptual model (T4). The primary goal is to create an API that is intuitive, efficient, and developer-friendly for users working with 3D data.\n\n### 1. Target Users and Use Cases\n\n*   **Primary Users:** 3D artists, game developers, AR/VR developers, CAD engineers, visualization specialists.\n*   **Key Use Cases:** \n    *   Loading and manipulating 3D models.\n    *   Assembling and managing complex 3D scenes.\n    *   Applying materials and textures.\n    *   Animating objects.\n    *   Generating rendered images or sequences from scenes.\n    *   Integrating 3D assets into applications and workflows.\n\n### 2. UX Principles\n\n*   **Simplicity and Intuitiveness:** The API should be easy to understand and use, with a clear and consistent structure.\n*   **Discoverability:** Users should be able to easily find and understand the available functionalities and how to use them.\n*   **Efficiency:** Operations should be performant, and common workflows should be streamlined.\n*   **Feedback and Clarity:** The API should provide clear feedback on operations, including status updates for asynchronous tasks and informative error messages.\n*   **Developer Experience (DX):** Comprehensive documentation, clear examples, and predictable behavior are crucial.\n\n### 3. Interaction Model\n\nThe interaction model will primarily be based on a RESTful API architecture, leveraging standard HTTP methods and JSON-based request/response bodies. Asynchronous operations will be supported for computationally intensive tasks.\n\n**3.1. Core Resource Representation:**\n\n*   The API will expose resources corresponding to the core abstractions defined in the conceptual model (T4): `Asset`, `Model`, `Material`, `Scene`, `RenderJob`, etc.\n*   Each resource will have a unique identifier (e.g., UUID) and a defined schema for its representation (likely JSON).\n*   **Example:** A request to retrieve a model might look like:\n    ```http\n    GET /api/v1/models/{model_id}\n    ```\n    The response would be a JSON object representing the `ModelResource`.\n\n**3.2. CRUD Operations:**\n\n*   Standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations will be supported for manageable resources like `Assets`, `Materials`, and `Scenes`.\n*   **Create:** `POST` requests (e.g., `POST /api/v1/models` for uploading a model).\n*   **Read:** `GET` requests (e.g., `GET /api/v1/scenes/{scene_id}`).\n*   **Update:** `PUT` or `PATCH` requests (e.g., `PATCH /api/v1/materials/{material_id}`).\n*   **Delete:** `DELETE` requests (e.g., `DELETE /api/v1/assets/{asset_id}`).\n\n**3.3. Asynchronous Operations (e.g., Rendering):**\n\n*   For long-running tasks like rendering, an asynchronous pattern will be employed:\n    1.  **Initiation:** A `POST` request to trigger the operation (e.g., `POST /api/v1/render_jobs`) with the necessary configuration (`RenderConfiguration`).\n    2.  **Response:** The API immediately returns a `RenderJob` resource with a status of `QUEUED` and a unique `job_id`.\n    3.  **Status Tracking:** Clients poll a `GET` endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/render_jobs/{job_id}`) to track the job's progress (`QUEUED`, `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`).\n    4.  **Result Retrieval:** Upon completion, the `RenderJob` resource will contain a link or reference to the output asset.\n\n**3.4. Data Formats:**\n\n*   **Requests:** Primarily JSON for structured data (e.g., scene definitions, material parameters).\n*   **File Uploads:** Support for standard 3D file formats (glTF, OBJ, FBX, USDZ) via `multipart/form-data`.\n*   **Responses:** JSON for resource representations and status information. Binary data (e.g., rendered images) will be returned with appropriate `Content-Type` headers.\n\n### 4. Key Interaction Patterns & Flows\n\n*   **Model Upload and Usage:** User uploads a model (`POST /api/v1/assets`), receives an `asset_id`. This `asset_id` is then used when defining a `Scene` or applying it to a `SceneNode`.\n*   **Scene Creation and Rendering:** User defines a scene by referencing `asset_id`s for models and materials (`POST /api/v1/scenes`). User then initiates a render job (`POST /api/v1/render_jobs`) specifying the `scene_id` and `RenderConfiguration`. User polls for job status and retrieves the rendered output.\n*   **Material Application:** User creates or retrieves a `MaterialDefinition`, then associates it with a `SceneNode` within a `SceneDescription`.\n\n### 5. Usability and Developer Experience Considerations\n\n*   **Clear API Documentation:** Comprehensive, searchable documentation with examples for all endpoints and core concepts is paramount. This aligns with NFR2.7.2.\n*   **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Use clear and predictable names for endpoints, parameters, and resource fields.\n*   **Informative Error Messages:** Provide detailed error messages that explain the cause of failure and suggest possible solutions, aligning with NFR2.8.2.\n*   **SDKs (Optional but Recommended):** Consider providing client SDKs in popular languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) to abstract away HTTP calls and simplify integration.\n*   **Versioning:** Implement API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`) to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility.\n*   **Rate Limiting Feedback:** Clearly communicate rate limits and provide appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) when limits are exceeded (FR1.3.4).\n\n### 6. Future Considerations\n\n*   **Real-time Collaboration Features:** If applicable, explore WebSockets for real-time updates.\n*   **Interactive Previews:** Potentially offer endpoints for generating low-resolution previews or thumbnails.\n\nThis design focuses on providing a robust yet accessible interface for interacting with 3D data, balancing the need for powerful features with ease of use for developers.",
