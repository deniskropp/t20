  "reasoning": "The user wants me to define the terminology and vocabulary for the 3D API domain. I have been provided with the output from the Requirements Analyst (T2) and the Conceptual Analyst (T4). The Requirements Analyst's output details the functional and non-functional requirements, specifying various services like Geometry, Scene Management, Rendering, and Material & Texture. The Conceptual Analyst's output provides a conceptual model with key entities like Asset, Model, Scene, Material, Camera, Light, Animation, and RenderJob, along with core abstractions such as AssetIdentifier, ModelResource, MaterialDefinition, SceneDescription, SceneNode, RenderConfiguration, RenderJobStatus, and AnimationData. My task is to consolidate this information into a comprehensive glossary or lexicon for the 3D API domain. I will structure this by defining key terms, providing their descriptions, and noting their relevance or context within the API.",

This glossary serves as a reference for consistent communication and development within the project.\n\n### Core Concepts & Entities\n\n*   **Asset:** A fundamental, addressable resource within the 3D API ecosystem. Assets can be models, textures, materials, animations, or other related data. Each asset has a unique identifier.\n    *   *Context:* Represents individual components that can be uploaded, stored, and referenced.\n\n*   **Model:** A specific type of Asset that defines 3D geometry. It includes mesh data (vertices, faces, normals, UVs) and can represent a single object or a hierarchical scene structure.\n    *   *Context:* Loaded and manipulated by the Geometry Service; forms the visual representation of objects.\n\n*   **Texture:** A specific type of Asset representing image data used to define surface appearance (e.g., color, roughness, normal maps).\n    *   *Context:* Applied to Materials; enhances the visual detail of Models.\n\n*   **Material:** Defines the surface properties of a 3D object, dictating how light interacts with it. Materials reference Textures and define shader parameters.\n    *   *Context:* Used by the Rendering Service to determine the visual appearance of Models.\n\n*   **Scene:** An organized collection of 3D objects (Models), lights, cameras, and their hierarchical relationships, defining a virtual environment.\n    *   *Context:* Managed by the Scene Management Service; the primary context for rendering.\n\n*   **SceneNode:** An element within a Scene's hierarchy. Each SceneNode has a transformation (position, rotation, scale) and can reference a Model, materials, or contain child SceneNodes.\n    *   *Context:* Enables hierarchical organization and transformations within a Scene.\n\n*   **Camera:** Defines the viewpoint from which a Scene is rendered. Specifies projection type, field of view, and clipping planes.\n    *   *Context:* Configured within a Scene or RenderConfiguration; used by the Rendering Service.\n\n*   **Light:** Defines a light source within a Scene (e.g., directional, point, spot). Specifies type, color, and intensity.\n    *   *Context:* Adds illumination to a Scene; affects how Models appear when rendered.\n\n*   **Animation:** Represents time-based changes to properties of SceneNodes or other elements (e.g., skeletal animation, morph targets).\n    *   *Context:* Managed by the Animation Service; provides dynamic visual changes.\n\n*   **RenderJob:** Represents a request to generate a 2D image or sequence from a 3D Scene using specified configurations.\n    *   *Context:* Handled by the Rendering Service, often asynchronously; produces output assets.\n\n### Core Abstractions & Data Types\n\n*   **`AssetIdentifier`:** A unique identifier used to reference any type of Asset within the API.\n    *   *Purpose:* Provides a consistent way to refer to assets regardless of their type or storage location.\n\n*   **`ModelResource`:** An object representing a loaded 3D model, exposing its geometry, scene graph, and metadata.\n    *   *Purpose:* Encapsulates model data for manipulation and rendering.\n\n*   **`MaterialDefinition`:** A data structure defining the parameters and texture references for a specific material.\n    *   *Purpose:* Allows for the creation and modification of surface appearances.\n\n*   **`SceneDescription`:** A structured representation of a Scene, including its nodes, lights, cameras, and environment settings.\n    *   *Purpose:* Defines the complete state of a virtual environment.\n\n*   **`SceneNode` (Abstraction):** A representation of a node within the scene graph, including its transformation and child/model references.\n    *   *Purpose:* Facilitates hierarchical scene construction and manipulation.\n\n*   **`RenderConfiguration`:** Specifies all necessary parameters for a rendering operation, including camera settings, output format, and resolution.\n    *   *Purpose:* Controls the output and quality of rendered images.\n\n*   **`RenderJobStatus`:** An enumeration indicating the current state of an asynchronous RenderJob (e.g., `QUEUED`, `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`).\n    *   *Purpose:* Allows clients to track the progress of background tasks.\n\n*   **`AnimationData`:** A structure containing keyframes and track information for a specific animation.\n    *   *Purpose:* Manages animation playback and manipulation data.\n\n### Services & Functionality\n\n*   **Geometry Service:** Handles loading, parsing, validation, and manipulation of 3D model data.\n    *   *Key Operations:* Load Model, Parse Geometry, Validate Mesh, Transform Model, Merge Meshes.\n\n*   **Scene Management Service:** Manages the creation, organization, and manipulation of 3D Scenes and their hierarchical structures (SceneNodes).\n    *   *Key Operations:* Create Scene, Add/Remove Node, Set Parent, Attach Model, Define Camera/Light.\n\n*   **Rendering Service:** Generates 2D representations (images, frames) from 3D Scenes based on camera and lighting configurations.\n    *   *Key Operations:* Render Scene, Configure Renderer, Generate Image.\n\n*   **Material & Texture Service:** Manages the definition, application, and loading of materials and textures.\n    *   *Key Operations:* Create Material, Apply Texture, Update Material Properties.\n\n*   **Animation Service:** Supports the definition, playback, and manipulation of animations.\n    *   *Key Operations:* Load Animation, Play Animation, Update Animation State.\n\n*   **API Gateway:** The primary entry point for all client interactions, handling request routing, authentication, and rate limiting.\n    *   *Key Operations:* Authenticate Request, Route Request, Apply Rate Limits.\n\n*   **Asset Storage:** The system component responsible for the upload, storage, and retrieval of 3D assets.\n    *   *Key Operations:* Upload Asset, Download Asset, List Assets.\n\n*   **Database:** Stores metadata related to assets, scenes, users, and API usage.\n    *   *Purpose:* Persistence and retrieval of descriptive information.\n\n### Non-Functional Attributes\n\n*   **Latency:** The time delay for API operations.\n*   **Scalability:** The ability of the API to handle increasing load.\n*   **Availability:** The percentage of time the API is operational.\n*   **Extensibility:** The ease with which new features or formats can be added.\n*   **Interoperability:** The ability to integrate with other systems and standards.\n*   **Security:** Measures taken to protect data and access.\n*   **Usability:** The ease with which developers can use the API.\n*   **Maintainability:** The ease with which the API can be modified and debugged.",
