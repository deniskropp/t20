## Quality Assurance Plan for 3D API

This document outlines the Quality Assurance (QA) plan for the integrated 3D API system. The objective is to ensure the system's reliability, functionality, performance, and security meet the defined requirements and quality standards.

### 1. Scope of Testing

The QA testing will cover the entire integrated system, including:

*   **Core Architecture:** Verification of microservices interaction, API Gateway functionality, and inter-service communication (as per T5 and T34).
*   **Data Ingestion and Management:** Testing of upload endpoints, data validation rules, and integration with external sources (as per T18, T19, T20, and T34).
*   **Workflows:** End-to-end testing of critical workflows such as Asset Ingestion, Scene Management, and Rendering (as per T32 and T34).
*   **Configuration Management:** Validation of how configurations are applied and respected across different services and environments (as per T33 and T34).
*   **Response Handling:** Ensuring consistency and correctness of API responses, including success and error conditions (as per T24 and T34).
*   **Security:** Assessing vulnerabilities and ensuring data protection.
*   **Performance:** Evaluating the system's responsiveness and scalability under various load conditions.

### 2. Testing Methodologies and Types

The following testing types will be employed:

*   **Functional Testing:** Verifying that each component and the integrated system perform their intended functions correctly. This includes testing API endpoints, data processing logic, and workflow executions.
*   **Integration Testing:** Focusing on the interfaces and interactions between different components and services to ensure they communicate and operate seamlessly, as described in the System Integration Summary (T34).
*   **End-to-End Testing:** Simulating real-user scenarios from the initial request to the final response, covering complete workflows.
*   **Performance Testing:** Conducting load, stress, and soak testing to assess the API's performance under expected and peak loads, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring scalability.
*   **Security Testing:** Performing vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and access control checks to identify and mitigate security risks.
*   **Usability Testing (if applicable):** Evaluating the ease of use and developer experience of interacting with the API.
*   **Regression Testing:** Re-testing previously tested functionalities after code changes or bug fixes to ensure no new issues have been introduced.

### 3. Test Environment

A dedicated QA environment will be set up, mirroring the production environment as closely as possible, including infrastructure, configurations, and sample data.

### 4. Test Cases and Scenarios

Detailed test cases will be developed for each testing type, covering:

*   **Happy Paths:** Testing successful operations with valid inputs.
*   **Negative Paths:** Testing with invalid inputs, edge cases, and error conditions to verify error handling and resilience.
*   **Boundary Value Analysis:** Testing at the boundaries of input ranges.
*   **Concurrency Scenarios:** Testing simultaneous requests and operations to identify race conditions.

### 5. Tools and Technologies

*   **API Testing Tools:** Postman, Insomnia, or similar for functional and integration testing.
*   **Performance Testing Tools:** JMeter, k6, or Locust for load and stress testing.
*   **Security Testing Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite for vulnerability scanning.
*   **Test Automation Framework:** A framework (e.g., using Python with `pytest` or JavaScript with `Jest`) to automate regression tests and repetitive functional tests.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Integrating QA tests into the CI/CD pipeline to enable continuous testing and early detection of issues.

### 6. Validation Criteria

The system will be considered validated when:

*   All critical and high-priority test cases pass.
*   Performance metrics meet the defined thresholds (e.g., response times, throughput).
*   No critical security vulnerabilities are identified.
*   The integrated system functions cohesively as per the System Integration Summary (T34).

### 7. Reporting

Regular QA reports will be generated, including test execution status, defect summaries, performance metrics, and overall system quality assessment.
