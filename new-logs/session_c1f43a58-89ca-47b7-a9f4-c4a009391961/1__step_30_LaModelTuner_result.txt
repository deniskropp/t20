  "reasoning": "The sub-task is to 'Tune underlying models and algorithms to improve API performance.' The provided inputs are the 'Metrics for Evaluation' (T12) and 'Actionable Insights from Data Patterns for 3D API Development' (T23). The Metrics document (T12) gives specific targets for performance (latency, throughput, resource utilization, model loading time, rendering time). The Insights document (T23) highlights the need for flexibility, robust validation, metadata-driven operations, dependency management, asynchronous processing for intensive tasks, and optimization for large data volumes, all of which indirectly impact performance. My role as a Model Tuner (T31) requires me to use these inputs to propose specific tuning strategies for the models and algorithms that underpin the 3D API's performance. I will focus on how to leverage the insights to achieve the performance targets defined by the metrics.",
