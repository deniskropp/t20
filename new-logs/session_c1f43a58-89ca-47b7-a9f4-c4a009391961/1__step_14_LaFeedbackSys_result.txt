  "reasoning": "The sub-task is to establish a feedback collection and processing mechanism for the 3D API. The `LaFeedbackSys` role is assigned to this task. To establish this mechanism, I need to define the key components and processes involved. This includes identifying how feedback will be collected (e.g., API endpoints, user forms), how it will be stored, how it will be processed (e.g., categorization, analysis), and how it will be used to inform improvements. The requirements document (T2) provides context on the API's intended functionality and quality attributes, which are important for understanding what kind of feedback is relevant. I will outline a plan that covers these aspects.",
  "output": "## Feedback Collection and Processing Mechanism for the 3D API\n\nThis document outlines a proposed mechanism for collecting, processing, and acting upon feedback related to the 3D API. The goal is to create a continuous improvement loop, ensuring the API meets user needs and evolves effectively.\n\n### 1. Feedback Collection Channels\n\nMultiple channels will be established to facilitate diverse feedback sources:\n\n*   **API Endpoint for Direct Feedback:** A dedicated API endpoint (e.g., `/feedback`) will be created to allow programmatic submission of feedback. This endpoint will accept structured data including feedback type (bug report, feature request, general comment), severity, description, and optionally, user ID and relevant context (e.g., API endpoint used, request parameters).\n*   **User Interface Integration:** If a user-facing interface or dashboard is developed for the API, a simple feedback form will be integrated within it. This form will guide users to provide specific and actionable feedback.\n*   **Developer Portal/Documentation:** A section within the API's developer portal or documentation will provide clear instructions on how users can submit feedback, potentially linking to the direct feedback endpoint or a dedicated issue tracker.\n*   **Community Forums/Channels:** If a community is established around the API, designated channels (e.g., forum threads, Discord channels) can be monitored for user feedback.\n\n### 2. Feedback Storage\n\nCollected feedback will be stored in a centralized and queryable manner. A dedicated database or a section within the existing metadata database will be used. Each feedback entry will include:\n\n*   Unique Feedback ID\n*   Timestamp of submission\n*   Source channel (API, UI, etc.)\n*   Feedback Type (Bug, Feature Request, Usability, Performance, Other)\n*   Severity Level (e.g., Critical, Major, Minor, Suggestion)\n*   Detailed Description\n*   User ID (if authenticated)\n*   Associated API context (endpoint, parameters, response)\n*   Status (e.g., New, Under Review, Actioned, Resolved, Won't Fix)\n*   Assigned team/individual (for tracking)\n\n### 3. Feedback Processing Workflow\n\nUpon submission, feedback will enter a defined processing workflow:\n\n1.  **Ingestion & Logging:** All feedback is immediately logged and assigned a unique ID.\n2.  **Initial Triage (Automated/Manual):** Feedback is automatically categorized based on keywords and type. A preliminary severity assessment may also be performed. Manual review will be conducted for ambiguous or high-priority feedback.\n3.  **Categorization & Tagging:** Feedback will be tagged with relevant keywords, API components (e.g., Geometry Service, Rendering Service), and functional areas.\n4.  **Prioritization:** Based on severity, impact, and alignment with project goals, feedback will be prioritized for review and action.\n5.  **Assignment:** Feedback requiring specific action (e.g., bug fixing, feature development) will be assigned to the appropriate team or individual.\n6.  **Analysis & Root Cause Identification:** For bug reports, detailed analysis will be performed to identify the root cause.\n7.  **Action Planning:** Based on the analysis and prioritization, a plan for addressing the feedback will be developed (e.g., creating a bug ticket, adding a feature to the roadmap).\n8.  **Resolution & Communication:** Once action is taken, the feedback status will be updated, and relevant users (if applicable) may be notified.\n\n### 4. Feedback Processing Roles\n\n*   **Feedback Processor (LaFeedbackProc):** Responsible for the initial triage, categorization, and tagging of incoming feedback.\n*   **Improvement Analyst (LaImproveAna):** Analyzes processed feedback in conjunction with performance metrics to identify trends, prioritize issues, and suggest improvements.\n*   **Refinement Strategist (LaRefineStrat):** Develops strategies for implementing improvements based on feedback analysis.\n*   **Model Tuner (LaModelTuner) / Relevant Service Owners:** Address specific technical issues or implement new features based on feedback.\n\n### 5. Integration with Development Lifecycle\n\n*   **Regular Review Meetings:** Feedback trends and high-priority items will be discussed in regular team meetings.\n*   **Roadmap Integration:** Feature requests and significant improvement suggestions will be incorporated into the API's product roadmap.\n*   **Bug Tracking:** Critical bugs identified through feedback will be logged in the project's issue tracking system.\n*   **Metrics Alignment:** Feedback related to performance and usability will be correlated with defined metrics (NFRs) to gauge effectiveness of improvements.\n\n### 6. Tools and Technologies\n\n*   **API Framework:** For the feedback endpoint.\n*   **Database:** For storing feedback data.\n*   **Issue Tracking System:** (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) for managing action items.\n*   **Analytics Tools:** For analyzing feedback trends and correlating with usage data.\n\nThis mechanism ensures that user and developer input is systematically captured, analyzed, and used to drive the continuous improvement of the 3D API.",
