## Processing and Categorization of User Feedback for the 3D API

This document details the process for categorizing and tagging user feedback received through the established feedback mechanism (as defined by T15). The goal is to transform raw feedback into actionable insights for the development team.

### 1. Feedback Triage and Initial Assessment

Upon receipt, feedback will undergo an initial triage to determine its nature and severity. This may involve automated keyword analysis and/or manual review by the Feedback Processor (LaFeedbackProc).

### 2. Primary Feedback Categories

Feedback will be assigned to one of the following primary categories:

*   **Bug Report:** Describes an issue where the API is not behaving as expected or is producing erroneous results.
    *   **Example:** "The `set_object_color` function returned an error code when a negative RGB value was provided."
*   **Feature Request:** Suggests new functionality or enhancements to existing features.
    *   **Example:** "It would be useful to have an endpoint for batch operations to improve efficiency."
*   **Usability Issue:** Pertains to the ease of use, clarity of documentation, or intuitiveness of the API design.
    *   **Example:** "The naming convention for the transformation matrices is confusing; it's unclear if it's row-major or column-major."
*   **Performance Concern:** Relates to the speed, resource consumption, or scalability of the API.
    *   **Example:** "Loading large 3D models via the `load_model` endpoint takes an excessive amount of time."
*   **Documentation Feedback:** Comments or suggestions specifically about the API's documentation.
    *   **Example:** "The example code for texture mapping is missing."
*   **General Comment/Other:** Feedback that does not fit neatly into the above categories.
    *   **Example:** "Overall, the API is well-designed and easy to integrate."

### 3. Categorization and Tagging Process

For each piece of feedback, the following steps will be performed:

1.  **Assign Primary Category:** Based on the content, select the most appropriate primary category from the list above.
2.  **Extract Keywords and Assign Tags:** Identify key terms, concepts, and affected components within the feedback. Assign relevant tags to facilitate filtering and analysis.

### 4. Suggested Tags for 3D API Feedback

Tags will provide granular detail for deeper analysis. Examples include:

**General/Core API:**
*   `authentication`
*   `rate_limiting`
*   `versioning`
*   `error_handling`

**Geometry & Modeling:**
*   `mesh`
*   `vertices`
*   `normals`
*   `uv_coordinates`
*   `primitives` (e.g., `cube`, `sphere`)
*   `import` (e.g., `obj`, `fbx`, `gltf`)
*   `export`
*   `transformations` (e.g., `translation`, `rotation`, `scaling`)
*   `boolean_operations`
*   `mesh_simplification`

**Rendering & Materials:**
*   `materials`
*   `shaders`
*   `textures`
*   `lighting`
*   `camera`
*   `rendering_pipeline`
*   `realtime_rendering`
*   `ray_tracing`

**Scene Management:**
*   `scene_graph`
*   `object_management`
*   `hierarchy`
*   `instancing`

**Animation:**
*   `skeletal_animation`
*   `morph_targets`
*   `keyframes`

**Data Formats & Standards:**
*   `glTF`
*   `USD`
*   `FBX`
*   `OBJ`

**Performance & Optimization:**
*   `load_time`
*   `memory_usage`
*   `gpu_usage`
*   `draw_calls`
*   `serialization`
*   `deserialization`

**Documentation & Examples:**
*   `api_reference`
*   `sdk_examples`
*   `tutorials`
*   `code_snippets`

### 5. Example Feedback Processing

**Feedback:** "The `load_model` endpoint is extremely slow when I try to load a complex glTF file with many PBR materials. It takes over a minute, and the documentation doesn't mention any optimization tips."

*   **Primary Category:** Performance Concern
*   **Tags:** `load_time`, `glTF`, `materials`, `documentation_feedback`, `optimization`

### 6. Actionable Insights

This structured categorization and tagging will enable:

*   **Trend Analysis:** Identifying recurring issues or popular feature requests.
*   **Prioritization:** Helping the Improvement Analyst (LaImproveAna) and Refinement Strategist (LaRefineStrat) prioritize development efforts.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Pinpointing specific components or functionalities that require attention.
*   **Documentation Improvement:** Highlighting areas where documentation is lacking or unclear.

By systematically processing and categorizing feedback, we ensure that user input directly contributes to the iterative improvement and success of the 3D API.
