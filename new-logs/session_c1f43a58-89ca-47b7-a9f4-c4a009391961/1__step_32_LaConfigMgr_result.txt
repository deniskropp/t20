  "reasoning": "The sub-task is to 'Manage the configuration and settings of the 3D API.' I have received the System Design document (T5) which outlines the technology stack and architectural decisions, and the Workflow Designs document (T32) which details how various operations will be executed. My role as Configuration Manager (T33) requires me to define how these configurations will be managed. This involves identifying key configuration parameters for the services, defining strategies for managing these configurations (e.g., environment variables, configuration files, external config servers), and outlining a process for updating and applying configurations. This ensures the API can be deployed, scaled, and maintained effectively across different environments.",
  "output": "## 3D API Configuration Management Plan\n\nThis document outlines the strategy for managing the configuration and settings of the 3D API. Effective configuration management is crucial for deployment, scalability, and maintainability across various environments (development, staging, production).\n\n### 1. Key Configuration Areas\n\nBased on the System Design (T5) and Workflow Designs (T32), the following areas require configuration management:\n\n*   **API Gateway (Kong):**\n    *   Service discovery endpoints.\n    *   Authentication provider details (e.g., JWT secret key).\n    *   Rate limiting policies.\n    *   Plugin configurations.\n    *   Upstream service addresses.\n*   **Core Microservices (e.g., Geometry, Scene, Rendering, Material, Animation):**\n    *   Database connection strings (primary DB, potentially read replicas).\n    *   Object storage (S3) credentials and bucket names.\n    *   Message Queue connection details (broker address, queue names, credentials).\n    *   Logging levels and destinations.\n    *   Service-specific parameters (e.g., rendering engine paths, model processing thresholds).\n    *   Internal communication settings (e.g., gRPC endpoints).\n*   **Worker Services (Data Validator, Rendering Worker, etc.):**\n    *   Message Queue connection details.\n    *   Database connection strings.\n    *   Object storage credentials.\n    *   Processing-specific parameters (e.g., number of concurrent tasks, retry attempts).\n*   **Database:**\n    *   Connection pooling settings.\n    *   Replication/failover configurations.\n*   **Object Storage (S3):\n    *   Region, endpoint (if self-hosted).\n*   **Kubernetes Cluster:**\n    *   Resource limits and requests for pods.\n    *   Ingress controller settings.\n    *   Network policies.\n\n### 2. Configuration Management Strategy\n\nA hybrid approach will be adopted, leveraging Kubernetes' native capabilities and external configuration management tools where appropriate.\n\n*   **Environment Variables:** Used for sensitive information (credentials, API keys) and basic settings that are environment-specific. These will be injected into containers via Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps.\n*   **Kubernetes ConfigMaps:** Store non-sensitive configuration data (e.g., service URLs, feature flags, logging levels) in ConfigMaps. Each microservice will mount specific ConfigMaps as files or environment variables.\n*   **Kubernetes Secrets:** Store sensitive configuration data (e.g., database passwords, S3 access keys, JWT secrets). These will be mounted as environment variables or files.\n*   **External Configuration Server (Optional, for advanced needs):** For more complex scenarios or dynamic configuration updates across many services, consider using a dedicated configuration server like HashiCorp Consul or Spring Cloud Config. This would allow for centralized management and dynamic reloads without redeploying services.\n*   **Declarative Configuration (Infrastructure as Code):** All Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets) will be managed using Infrastructure as Code principles (e.g., YAML files stored in version control). This ensures reproducibility and traceability.\n\n### 3. Configuration Loading and Application\n\n*   **Service Startup:** Each microservice will be designed to read its configuration from environment variables and/or mounted configuration files upon startup.\n*   **Dynamic Reloading (where applicable):** For certain non-critical configurations (e.g., logging levels), services may implement mechanisms to reload configuration dynamically without requiring a restart. This can be achieved by monitoring configuration files or using specific library features.\n*   **API Gateway Configuration:** Kong's configuration can be managed via its Admin API, often integrated into CI/CD pipelines or managed using declarative configuration tools (e.g., Kongfig, Terraform providers).\n\n### 4. Environment-Specific Configurations\n\n*   **Development:** Local configurations might use Docker Compose with `.env` files. Kubernetes configurations will use separate `dev` namespaces with specific ConfigMaps and Secrets.\n*   **Staging:** Staging environment configurations will mirror production as closely as possible, using dedicated ConfigMaps and Secrets for the staging namespace.\n*   **Production:** Production configurations will be managed with the highest security and reliability standards, utilizing Kubernetes Secrets and carefully managed ConfigMaps within the production namespace.\n\n### 5. Process for Updates\n\n1.  **Identify Change:** A need for configuration change is identified (e.g., tuning a database connection pool, updating an S3 bucket name).\n2.  **Update Configuration Source:** Modify the relevant Kubernetes ConfigMap/Secret YAML file or update the external configuration server.\n3.  **Version Control:** Commit the changes to the version control system.\n4.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** The CI/CD pipeline detects the change and applies the updated configuration to the target environment (e.g., `kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml`).\n5.  **Service Reload/Restart:** Services that rely on the changed configuration will either automatically reload it or require a rolling restart orchestrated by Kubernetes.\n6.  **Verification:** Monitor application logs and health checks to ensure the configuration change has been applied correctly and the service is operating as expected.\n\nThis plan provides a framework for managing the diverse configuration needs of the 3D API, ensuring consistency, security, and ease of management throughout its lifecycle.",
