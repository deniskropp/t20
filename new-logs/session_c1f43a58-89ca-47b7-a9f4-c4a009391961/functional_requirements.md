## 3D API: Functional Requirements

These requirements define the specific capabilities and features the 3D API must provide.

**1.1. Core Services Functionality:**

*   **FR1.1.1 (Geometry Service):** The API must support loading and parsing of various 3D model file formats (e.g., glTF, OBJ, FBX, USDZ). 
*   **FR1.1.2 (Geometry Service):** The API must provide functionalities for basic 3D model manipulation, including transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), mesh operations (e.g., merging, splitting), and vertex/face manipulation.
*   **FR1.1.3 (Geometry Service):** The API must validate the integrity and structure of uploaded 3D models.
*   **FR1.1.4 (Scene Management Service):** The API must allow users to define and manage 3D scenes, including the composition of multiple 3D objects, hierarchical structuring, and scene graph management.
*   **FR1.1.5 (Scene Management Service):** The API must support the definition and management of scene elements such as cameras (perspective, orthographic) and lights (directional, point, spot).
*   **FR1.1.6 (Rendering Service):** The API must be able to generate 2D representations (e.g., images, potentially video frames) of 3D scenes based on defined camera views and scene configurations.
*   **FR1.1.7 (Rendering Service):** The API should support different rendering techniques (e.g., rasterization, ray tracing) and quality settings.
*   **FR1.1.8 (Material & Texture Service):** The API must support the definition and application of materials, including standard (e.g., PBR) and custom material properties.
*   **FR1.1.9 (Material & Texture Service):** The API must handle the loading, processing, and application of textures (e.g., diffuse, normal, metallic-roughness maps).
*   **FR1.1.10 (Animation Service):** The API must support the playback and manipulation of skeletal animations and morph target animations.

**1.2. Data Management Functionality:**

*   **FR1.2.1 (Asset Storage):** The API must provide mechanisms for uploading, storing, and retrieving 3D assets (models, textures, etc.).
*   **FR1.2.2 (Database):** The API must store and manage metadata associated with 3D assets, scene configurations, user data, and API usage.

**1.3. API Gateway Functionality:**

*   **FR1.3.1 (API Gateway):** The API must provide a unified entry point for all client interactions.
*   **FR1.3.2 (API Gateway):** The API must handle request routing to the appropriate backend services.
*   **FR1.3.3 (API Gateway):** The API must implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing its functionalities.
*   **FR1.3.4 (API Gateway):** The API must support rate limiting to manage request volume.

**1.4. Asynchronous Operations:**

*   **FR1.4.1 (Message Queue/Worker Services):** The API must support asynchronous processing for long-running operations such as complex rendering jobs or model conversions.
*   **FR1.4.2 (Message Queue/Worker Services):** The API must provide mechanisms for clients to track the status of asynchronous tasks.
