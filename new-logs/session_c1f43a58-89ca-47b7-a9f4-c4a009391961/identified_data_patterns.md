## Identified Patterns in Data for 3D API Design and Functionality

This document outlines key patterns identified in the data that will inform the design and functionality of the 3D API. These patterns are derived from the data types handled (as per T13) and the validation procedures established (as per T19).

### 1. Data Heterogeneity and Complexity

*   **Pattern:** The 3D API will ingest and manage a wide variety of 3D file formats (glTF, OBJ, FBX, STL, etc.), each with its own structure, features (e.g., animation, skeletal data, PBR materials), and potential for errors.
*   **Implication for API Design:**
    *   **Flexible Data Models:** The API's data models must be flexible enough to accommodate diverse attribute sets for different 3D formats.
    *   **Format Conversion/Normalization Endpoints:** Consider endpoints for converting assets between formats or normalizing them to a standard format (e.g., glTF) to simplify downstream processing.
    *   **Format-Aware Operations:** API operations (e.g., querying, filtering) should be aware of format-specific capabilities and limitations.

### 2. Validation Failure Trends

*   **Pattern:** Analysis of validation rules (T19) reveals common failure points such as non-manifold geometry, invalid UV coordinates, texture format issues, and metadata schema non-conformance.
*   **Implication for API Design:**
    *   **Proactive Data Cleaning/Repair Features:** The API could offer features or workflows to automatically detect and attempt to repair common geometric or material issues.
    *   **Enhanced Metadata Validation:** Provide richer validation options for metadata upon submission, guiding users to provide correct and complete information.
    *   **Error Reporting and Diagnostics:** API responses for failed operations should provide clear, actionable error messages and diagnostic information, potentially linking to specific validation rules.

### 3. Richness of Metadata and its Usage

*   **Pattern:** Assets are associated with diverse metadata, including descriptive information, technical specifications (poly count, texture resolution), usage rights, and tags. Users will likely query and filter assets based on this metadata.
*   **Implication for API Design:**
    *   **Robust Querying and Filtering:** Implement powerful search and filtering capabilities based on various metadata fields, including support for range queries, fuzzy matching, and tag-based filtering.
    *   **Metadata Management Endpoints:** Provide endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving asset metadata.
    *   **Standardized Metadata Schemas:** Define and enforce standardized metadata schemas to ensure consistency and interoperability.

### 4. Asset Dependencies (Textures, Materials, Scenes)

*   **Pattern:** 3D assets often consist of multiple interconnected components (e.g., a model file referencing texture files and material definitions, scene files referencing multiple models).
*   **Implication for API Design:**
    *   **Asset Relationships Management:** The API should manage and represent these relationships clearly, allowing users to query for related assets (e.g., find all textures for a given model).
    *   **Atomic Operations:** Consider operations that can handle collections of related assets, such as uploading a complete scene with all its dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Validation:** Ensure that when an asset is deleted or modified, its dependencies are handled appropriately.

### 5. Computational Intensity of Transformations

*   **Pattern:** Tasks like format conversion, mesh optimization, and texture compression are computationally intensive and best handled asynchronously (as per T13).
*   **Implication for API Design:**
    *   **Asynchronous Task API:** Design API endpoints that initiate long-running tasks and provide mechanisms for clients to poll for status updates and retrieve results.
    *   **Resource Management:** The API design should consider how to manage and expose information about available processing resources or task queues.

### 6. Data Volume and Storage Considerations

*   **Pattern:** 3D assets, especially with high-resolution textures and complex geometry, can result in large data volumes.
*   **Implication for API Design:**
    *   **Efficient Data Transfer:** Support efficient data transfer mechanisms (e.g., resumable uploads, multipart uploads).
    *   **Streaming and Partial Downloads:** For large assets, consider providing options for streaming or downloading only specific parts (e.g., geometry without textures).
    *   **Storage Tiering Awareness:** While primarily an infrastructure concern, the API could potentially expose information about asset storage tiers or access patterns.
