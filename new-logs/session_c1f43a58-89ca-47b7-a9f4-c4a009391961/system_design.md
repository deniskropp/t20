## 3D API: Initial System Design

This document outlines the initial system design for the 3D API, synthesizing the high-level architecture, functional/non-functional requirements, and core conceptual abstractions. It provides a more detailed blueprint for the development team.

### 1. Architectural Decisions & Technology Stack

Based on the microservices architecture (T1) and requirements (T2), the following technology stack is proposed:

*   **API Gateway:** 
    *   **Technology:** Kong API Gateway.
    *   **Rationale:** Offers robust features for routing, authentication (JWT, OAuth2), rate limiting, and plugin extensibility. Its declarative configuration supports microservices.
*   **Core Services (Geometry, Scene, Rendering, Material, Animation):**
    *   **Language/Framework:** Python (FastAPI/Flask) for rapid development and rich ecosystem, or Go for performance-critical services.
    *   **Rationale:** Python offers libraries for 3D manipulation (e.g., `trimesh`, `Open3D`) and web frameworks suitable for microservices. Go provides excellent concurrency and performance for compute-intensive tasks like rendering.
    *   **Containerization:** Docker.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
*   **Data Management:**
    *   **Asset Storage:** AWS S3 or compatible object storage (e.g., MinIO).
    *   **Rationale:** Scalable, durable, and cost-effective storage for large binary assets like 3D models and textures.
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension (for potential spatial queries) or MongoDB.
    *   **Rationale:** PostgreSQL offers relational integrity and powerful features. MongoDB provides flexibility for evolving metadata schemas.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:**
    *   **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or Kafka.
    *   **Rationale:** Robust message queuing systems for decoupling services and handling background tasks reliably. RabbitMQ is simpler for basic queuing, while Kafka offers higher throughput and stream processing capabilities.
*   **Inter-service Communication:** RESTful APIs for synchronous requests (e.g., to API Gateway) and gRPC for high-performance internal communication between core services where latency is critical. Asynchronous communication via the Message Queue.
*   **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes.
*   **Rationale:** Manages deployment, scaling, and networking of containerized microservices.

### 2. Data Models

Building upon the conceptual abstractions (T4), the following data models will guide the implementation:

*   **`Asset` Object:** 
    *   Schema will include `asset_id`, `asset_type`, `file_format`, `storage_path` (in S3), `upload_timestamp`, `metadata` (JSONB field).
*   **`Model` Representation:** 
    *   Geometry data will be stored efficiently (e.g., binary format, potentially optimized for web delivery like glTF). Metadata will include vertex/triangle counts, bounding boxes.
*   **`Scene` Object:** 
    *   Will store scene graph structure, references to `Asset` IDs for models, materials, lights, and cameras. Stored in the primary database.
*   **`RenderJob` Object:**
    *   Schema will include `job_id`, `scene_id`, `camera_config`, `output_format`, `resolution`, `status` (enum), `created_at`, `completed_at`, `output_path`.

### 3. API Design Considerations

*   **RESTful Principles:** Adhere to RESTful principles for external-facing APIs.
*   **Versioning:** Implement API versioning (e.g., `/v1/...`).
*   **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication, managed by the API Gateway.
*   **Standard Formats:** Prioritize glTF for model exchange due to its web-friendliness and extensibility.
*   **Error Handling:** Consistent error response format across all endpoints.
*   **Documentation:** OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for generating interactive documentation.

**Example Endpoints:**

*   `POST /v1/assets/upload`: Upload a new asset.
*   `GET /v1/assets/{asset_id}`: Retrieve asset metadata.
*   `POST /v1/scenes`: Create a new scene.
*   `PUT /v1/scenes/{scene_id}`: Update an existing scene.
*   `POST /v1/renderjobs`: Submit a new render job.
*   `GET /v1/renderjobs/{job_id}`: Get render job status and output URL.

### 4. Workflow & Interaction Patterns

*   **Asset Upload:** Client uploads asset -> API Gateway -> Geometry Service (validation, metadata extraction) -> Stores in S3 -> Records metadata in DB -> Returns `asset_id`.
*   **Scene Creation/Update:** Client defines scene structure (referencing `asset_id`s) -> API Gateway -> Scene Management Service -> Stores/updates scene definition in DB.
*   **Rendering Request:** Client requests render -> API Gateway -> Scene Service (retrieves scene) -> API Gateway -> Rendering Service (creates `RenderJob` entry, publishes message to Queue) -> Worker picks up job -> Rendering Service processes -> Stores output in S3 -> Updates `RenderJob` status in DB.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use of message queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for decoupling long-running tasks (rendering, complex model processing, conversions) from the main API request flow.

### 5. Deployment Strategy

*   **Infrastructure:** Cloud-based (AWS, GCP, Azure) leveraging managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS).
*   **CI/CD:** Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) for automated building, testing, and deployment of microservices.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for all services.

### 6. Security Considerations

*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Handled at the API Gateway. Fine-grained authorization within services as needed.
*   **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation at the API Gateway and service levels to prevent malformed data or security exploits.
*   **Secure Storage:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (HTTPS for all external communication).

This initial system design provides a concrete foundation for the subsequent development phases. It balances flexibility with the need for a robust and scalable architecture.
