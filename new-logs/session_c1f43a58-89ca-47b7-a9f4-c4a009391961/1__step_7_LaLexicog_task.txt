      "content": "## 3D API: Conceptual Model and Core Abstractions\n\nThis document defines the conceptual model and core abstractions for the 3D API, building upon the established architecture and requirements. The goal is to provide a clear, high-level understanding of the fundamental entities and their relationships that the API will manage and expose.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Model\n\nThe conceptual model represents the core entities and their interactions within the 3D API domain. It focuses on the 'what' the API deals with, abstracting away implementation details.\n\n**Key Entities:**\n\n*   **Asset:** Represents a fundamental 3D resource. This is a broad category that can encompass models, textures, materials, animations, and potentially other related data.\n    *   **Properties:** Unique Identifier, Type (e.g., 'model', 'texture'), File Format, Size, Metadata (e.g., author, creation date, usage rights).\n    *   **Relationships:** Can be associated with a Scene, used by a Material, or part of an Animation.\n\n*   **Model:** A specific type of Asset representing 3D geometry. This includes mesh data, vertex information, and potentially scene hierarchy information if it's a composite model.\n    *   **Properties:** Geometry Data (vertices, faces, normals, UVs), Bounding Box, File Format (e.g., glTF, OBJ).\n    *   **Relationships:** Belongs to an Asset, can be part of a Scene Node.\n\n*   **Texture:** A specific type of Asset representing image data used for surfaces.\n    *   **Properties:** Image Data, Dimensions, Format (e.g., PNG, JPG, KTX2), Usage Flags (e.g., diffuse, normal).\n    *   **Relationships:** Belongs to an Asset, applied to a Material.\n\n*   **Material:** Defines the surface properties of a 3D object. It dictates how light interacts with the surface.\n    *   **Properties:** Shader Type (e.g., PBR, Unlit), Parameters (e.g., albedo color, metallic, roughness, normal map texture reference, occlusion map texture reference).\n    *   **Relationships:** Applied to Model(s) or parts of a Model, references Textures.\n\n*   **Scene:** An organized collection of 3D objects, lights, cameras, and other elements that define a virtual environment.\n    *   **Properties:** Unique Identifier, Name, Root Node(s), Environment Settings (e.g., background color, skybox).\n    *   **Relationships:** Composed of Scene Nodes, may contain multiple Models, Materials, Lights, and Cameras.\n\n*   **SceneNode:** Represents an object within a Scene hierarchy. It defines a transformation (position, rotation, scale) and can contain references to Models, children SceneNodes, or other scene elements.\n    *   **Properties:** Transformation Matrix, Name, Parent Node reference, Child Node references, Attached Model reference.\n    *   **Relationships:** Part of a Scene, Parent/Child relationships, references Models and Materials.\n\n*   **Camera:** Defines the viewpoint from which a Scene is observed.\n    *   **Properties:** Type (Perspective, Orthographic), Field of View / Ortho Size, Aspect Ratio, Near/Far Clipping Planes, Position, Orientation.\n    *   **Relationships:** Associated with a Scene.\n\n*   **Light:** Defines a light source within a Scene.\n    *   **Properties:** Type (Directional, Point, Spot), Color, Intensity, Position, Direction.\n    *   **Relationships:** Associated with a Scene.\n\n*   **Animation:** Represents time-based changes to properties of SceneNodes or other elements.\n    *   **Properties:** Type (Skeletal, Morph Target), Duration, Keyframes.\n    *   **Relationships:** Can be applied to SceneNodes or Models.\n\n*   **RenderJob:** Represents a request to generate a 2D image or sequence from a Scene.\n    *   **Properties:** Unique Identifier, Scene Reference, Camera Configuration, Output Format, Resolution, Status (e.g., PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED), Output Location.\n    *   **Relationships:** Initiated by a user request, references a Scene, produces output assets.\n\n### 2.
