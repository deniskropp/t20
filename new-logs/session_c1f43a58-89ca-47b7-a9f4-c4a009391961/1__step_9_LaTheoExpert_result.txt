  "reasoning": "The current sub-task is to 'Establish theoretical foundations and principles for the 3D API.' This requires synthesizing information from the previous steps, particularly the high-level architecture (T1) and the functional/non-functional requirements (T2). The theoretical foundations should address the underlying concepts, models, and paradigms that will guide the API's design and implementation. This includes considering geometric principles, data structures for 3D representations, rendering theories, and principles of API design in the context of complex 3D data. The output will be a document outlining these theoretical aspects.",
  "output": "## Theoretical Foundations and Principles for the 3D API\n\nThis document outlines the theoretical foundations and guiding principles that will underpin the development of the 3D API. These principles are derived from the high-level architecture and requirements, aiming to ensure a robust, scalable, and versatile API.\n\n### 1. Core Theoretical Concepts:\n\n*   **Geometric Representation:**\n    *   **Principle:** Adhere to established mathematical and computational geometry principles for representing 3D objects. This includes supporting common primitives (points, lines, curves, surfaces, meshes) and ensuring data integrity through geometric constraints and validation.\n    *   **Foundation:** Utilize well-defined data structures for mesh representation (e.g., half-edge, winged-edge) and consider robust algorithms for geometric operations (e.g., boolean operations, triangulation, simplification).\n\n*   **Scene Graph Abstraction:**\n    *   **Principle:** Employ a hierarchical scene graph model as the primary organizational structure for 3D scenes. This facilitates hierarchical transformations, culling, and efficient scene traversal.\n    *   **Foundation:** Based on principles of tree data structures and hierarchical transformations (local to world space conversion).\n\n*   **PBR (Physically Based Rendering) Principles:**\n    *   **Principle:** Adopt PBR principles for material and lighting models to ensure realistic and consistent visual appearance across different lighting conditions and renderers.\n    *   **Foundation:** Based on the physical properties of light interaction with surfaces (e.g., energy conservation, microfacet theory).\n\n*   **Data Format Standardization:**\n    *   **Principle:** Prioritize support for industry-standard 3D file formats, with glTF as a primary target due to its web-friendliness and feature set. This ensures interoperability and reduces the need for custom format handling.\n    *   **Foundation:** Understanding the structure, semantics, and extensibility of key 3D formats.\n\n*   **API Design Paradigms:**\n    *   **Principle:** Employ RESTful principles for synchronous operations where appropriate, and leverage asynchronous patterns (e.g., message queues, webhooks) for long-running or resource-intensive tasks.\n    *   **Foundation:** Principles of statelessness, resource identification, and clear separation of concerns in API design.\n\n### 2. Guiding Principles:\n\n*   **Modularity and Composability:**\n    *   **Principle:** Design the API as a collection of independent, loosely coupled services that can be composed to achieve complex functionalities. This aligns with the microservices architecture and promotes maintainability and scalability.\n\n*   **Extensibility:**\n    *   **Principle:** The API should be designed to accommodate future growth, including support for new 3D formats, rendering techniques, and advanced features, with minimal disruption to existing functionality.\n\n*   **Performance and Efficiency:**\n    *   **Principle:** Optimize for performance at all levels, from data parsing and manipulation to rendering and data transfer. This involves choosing efficient algorithms and data structures, and supporting configurable quality/performance trade-offs.\n\n*   **Interoperability:**\n    *   **Principle:** Ensure seamless integration with other tools, platforms, and workflows within the 3D ecosystem by adhering to standards and providing clear integration points.\n\n*   **Scalability:**\n    *   **Principle:** The architecture and underlying technologies must support horizontal scaling to handle varying loads and a growing user base.\n\n*   **Maintainability and Testability:**\n    *   **Principle:** Foster a development environment where code is well-documented, modular, and easy to test, ensuring long-term health and reliability of the API.\n\n*   **Security by Design:**\n    *   **Principle:** Integrate security considerations from the outset, addressing authentication, authorization, data validation, and secure communication channels.\n\n### 3.

Theoretical considerations include manifoldness, watertightness, and geometric precision.\n*   **Scene Management Service:** Based on graph theory and hierarchical data structures. Theoretical considerations involve scene graph optimization, traversal algorithms, and efficient state management.\n*   **Rendering Service:** Grounded in computer graphics theory, including rasterization, ray tracing, shading models, and image processing. Theoretical considerations involve rendering equation, sampling techniques, and color spaces.\n*   **Material & Texture Service:** Draws from physics of light interaction and image processing. Theoretical considerations include BRDF/BSDF models, texture filtering, mipmapping, and color management.\n*   **Animation Service:** Based on kinematics, dynamics, and signal processing.
