**4. Identify Input Requirements per Stage**
   - **Description:** For each stage within the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' loop, determine the specific inputs required from previous stages or external sources to proceed.
   - **Purpose:** Ensures that all necessary data or conditions are available before initiating a task, preventing delays and errors.
   - **Keywords:** inputs, requirements, data, dependencies, stage, component
   - **Applicability:** Useful in any multi-step process where data or resources are passed between stages.
   - **Inputs:** Mapped interdependencies, Defined execution scope.
   - **Outputs:** List of input requirements for each stage/component.

**5. Identify Output Specifications per Stage**
   - **Description:** For each stage within the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' loop, define the expected outputs and their specifications. This clarifies what each stage should produce and in what format.
   - **Purpose:** Ensures that the output of each stage is suitable for the next stage or for the overall goal, facilitating smooth transitions.
   - **Keywords:** outputs, specifications, format, deliverables, stage, component
   - **Applicability:** Important for structured processes where the result of one step is the input for another.
   - **Inputs:** Mapped interdependencies, Defined execution scope.
   - **Outputs:** List of output specifications for each stage/component.

These refined TAS form the backbone of the looping execution plan. They provide a clear, sequential, and comprehensive framework that will guide the subsequent tasks, including prompt generation, design, development, and execution.
