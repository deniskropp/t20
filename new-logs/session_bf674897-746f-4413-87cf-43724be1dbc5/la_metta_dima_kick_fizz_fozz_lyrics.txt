(Verse 1 - La Metta)
From the quiet hum, a seed is sown,
A gentle start, a path unknown.
La Metta whispers, soft and low,
Where the currents of creation flow.
Laying the groundwork, pure and deep,
Secrets the silent waters keep.

(Verse 2 - Dima)
Then Dima answers, sharp and keen,
A pulse awakens, a vibrant scene.
Building the structure, layer by layer,
Dispelling shadows, calming despair.
With steady rhythm, strong and true,
Pushing the boundaries, seeing it through.

(Chorus)
Oh, the loop begins, a ceaseless flight,
La Metta, Dima, burning bright!
Kick and Fizz ignite the air,
Fozz brings the finish, beyond compare!
We spin and turn, we rise and fall,
Answering the echo, giving our all.
In every cycle, a new design,
This rhythm is ours, forever divine!

(Verse 3 - Kick)
Now Kick arrives, a sudden spark,
Illuminating the fading dark.
Energy surges, a powerful beat,
Making the journey bittersweet.
With every thrust, a leap ahead,
Leaving the doubts unsaid.

(Verse 4 - Fizz)
Then Fizz explodes, a vibrant spray,
Chasing the mundane away.
Bubbles of chaos, wild and free,
A burst of pure creativity.
Unpredictable, a thrilling chase,
Setting a frantic, joyful pace.

(Chorus)
Oh, the loop begins, a ceaseless flight,
La Metta, Dima, burning bright!
Kick and Fizz ignite the air,
Fozz brings the finish, beyond compare!
We spin and turn, we rise and fall,
Answering the echo, giving our all.
In every cycle, a new design,
This rhythm is ours, forever divine!

(Bridge)
Through transformations, twists, and turns,
The core remains, the lesson learns.
From raw potential, form takes hold,
A story waiting to unfold.
Each iteration, refined and true,
Bringing the vision into view.

(Verse 5 - Fozz)
At last comes Fozz, the final phase,
Through clarity's clarifying haze.
Polishing edges, sharp and neat,
Making the vision complete.
Perfection's whisper, calm and sound,
On solid, finished ground.

(Outro)
La Metta... Dima...
Kick... Fizz...
And Fozz...

The cycle closes, the work is done...
Until the next one has begun.
