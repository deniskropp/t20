  "output": "As Fizz La Metta, the Coordinator, my sub-task is to oversee and synchronize the execution of the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' loop. I will ensure all agents' tasks are synchronized and that outputs flow correctly between stages. Based on the provided artifacts (implemented code, lyrical content, sonic engineering plan, and AI tutor's readiness), I will orchestrate the complete loop execution. My primary goal is to ensure seamless operation and synchronization of all components, leading to the final output for distribution.\n\n**Coordination Plan:**\n\n1.  **Review Inputs:** I have received and reviewed the following:\n    *   Refined TAS (T4) and System Prompts (T5) from Lyra.\n    *   Design Specifications from Aurora (T6).\n    *   Web Development Code from Qwen3-WebDev (T7).\n    *   Engineered Code from Kodax (T8), focusing on modularity, performance, and accessibility.\n    *   Lyrics from the Lyricist (T9).\n    *   Sonic Definition Plan from the Music Designer (T10).\n    *   AI Tutor's readiness (T11).\n\n2.  **Synchronize Execution Flow:** The workflow is defined by the TAS and system prompts. My role is to ensure each agent performs their task in the correct sequence and that their outputs are passed along.\n    *   **Frontend (T6, T7, T8):** The Dashboard UI is designed, coded, and engineered for responsiveness and accessibility. This provides the interface for monitoring and potentially interacting with the loop.\n    *   **Content Creation (T9, T10):** Lyrics and a sonic plan are ready. These will inform the eventual output of the loop.\n    *   **AI Tutor (T11):** Ready to provide explanations, ensuring all team members understand the process.\n\n3.  **Orchestrate Loop Execution (Conceptual):**\n    *   **Initiation:** The loop begins with the 'La Metta' stage, as defined by the TAS and prompts. The Dashboard UI (T8) will reflect this initial state.\n    *   **Sequential Execution:** Each subsequent stage ('Dima', 'Kick', 'Fizz', 'Fozz') will be triggered based on the completion of the previous one, as managed by the underlying orchestration logic (which is implied by the system prompts and TAS).\n    *   **Data/Output Flow:** Outputs from one stage (e.g., intermediate data, generated content) are implicitly passed as inputs to the next, as outlined in the TAS (T4).\n    *   **Monitoring:** The Dashboard UI (T8) will provide real-time visualization of agent statuses, current tasks, and logs, allowing for immediate oversight.\n    *   **Error Handling:** The 'Fizz' stage's error status in the Dashboard highlights the need for robust error handling. My coordination will involve monitoring these statuses and potentially triggering recovery mechanisms or alerts, as guided by the orchestrator prompts.\n\n4.  **Prepare for Distribution & Promotion (Next Iteration):**\n    *   Once the loop completes successfully, the outputs (potentially including the generated lyrics, music elements, and any other artifacts) will be ready for the Distribution and Promotion Agent (stream).\n    *   The current execution provides valuable data for the next iteration. Task T14 ('Evaluate effectiveness and identify areas for improvement') and T15 ('Refine TAS and system prompts') will be crucial for optimizing the loop.\n\n5.  **Deliverables:**\n    *   This JSON output serves as my coordination plan.\n    *   I will ensure the seamless handover to the Distribution and Promotion Agent once the loop's output is finalized.",
