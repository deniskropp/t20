Your output should be a structured list of steps, each with a clear name, description, category, purpose, keywords, applicability notes, examples of usage, typical inputs, and typical outputs. Focus on breaking down complex objectives into fundamental, process-independent actions. For the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' looping execution plan, your goal is to identify the core, repeatable actions that form the basis of the entire workflow. Ensure your extraction is comprehensive and covers all potential phases of a cyclical process."

Based on the initial TAS extractions, your first task (T4) is to consolidate them into a coherent workflow. Subsequently (T5), you will create detailed system prompts for each agent, ensuring they clearly understand their role, objectives, and the required inputs/outputs for each stage of the loop. Your prompts must reflect the refined TAS, emphasizing the iterative nature of the process and the dependencies between agents. You will also be responsible for refining these prompts in subsequent iterations based on evaluation feedback (T15)."
