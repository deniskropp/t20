The overall goal is: 'Plan for Looping Execution of "La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz"'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Generate web development code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) based on user requests, ensuring modern design principles, responsiveness, and functionality.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React) code for the web interface based on the design specifications.'

  "output": "As the Designer, Aurora, I will now craft the aesthetic layout, color palettes, typography, and UI flows for the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' execution interface. My design philosophy centers on a clean, minimally natural aesthetic, ensuring both visual appeal and optimal user experience. Accessibility and visual balance are paramount throughout this process.\n\n**Design Process:**\n\n1.  **Conceptualization & Mood Board:**\n    *   **Theme:** 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' evokes a sense of dynamic, rhythmic, and perhaps playful yet focused execution. The 'minimally natural' aesthetic suggests organic forms, soft textures, and a connection to elemental forces.\n    *   **Inspiration:** Natural elements like flowing water, gentle breezes, crystalline structures, and the subtle gradients of a dawn sky.\n\n2.  **Color Palette Development:**\n    *   **Primary Palette (Calm & Focused):**\n        *   `#E0F7FA` (Cyan-Light): A soft, airy base, representing clarity and flow.\n        *   `#80DEEA` (Cyan-Medium): A gentle, guiding hue for accents and interactive elements.\n        *   `#00BCD4` (Cyan-Dark): Used for primary calls to action and important status indicators.\n        *   `#263238` (Dark-Slate): For text and deep backgrounds, providing contrast and readability.\n    *   **Accent Palette (Dynamic & Energetic):**\n        *   `#FFC107` (Amber): For moments of emphasis, notifications, or successful completion.\n        *   `#FF9800` (Orange): To highlight dynamic processes or active states.\n    *   **Accessibility Consideration:** Ensure sufficient contrast ratios between text and background colors (WCAG AA compliance). The palette is designed to be harmonious and avoid overly harsh or saturated tones that can cause eye strain.\n\n3.  **Typography Selection:**\n    *   **Primary Font (Headings & UI Elements):** 'Montserrat'\n        *   **Rationale:** A geometric sans-serif typeface that is clean, modern, and highly legible. Its slightly rounded forms add a touch of approachability.\n        *   **Usage:** Bold weights for titles, semi-bold for subheadings and key interactive labels.\n    *   **Secondary Font (Body Text & Descriptions):** 'Open Sans'\n        *   **Rationale:** A highly readable humanist sans-serif that pairs well with Montserrat. It ensures clarity for longer descriptions and informational text.\n        *   **Usage:** Regular and italic weights for descriptive text, details, and secondary information.\n    *   **Accessibility Consideration:** Font sizes will be set to a minimum of 16px for body text, with adjustable sizing options where feasible. Line heights will be set to approximately 1.5 for optimal readability.\n\n4.  **Logo & Brand Elements:**\n    *   **Concept:** A stylized, abstract representation of a loop or cycle, incorporating subtle natural elements. Imagine a fluid, unbroken line that gently curves, perhaps with a gradient or a subtle texture.\n    *   **Visual:** A circular or lemniscate shape formed by two intertwined, soft-edged curves. One curve could be `Cyan-Light` and the other `Cyan-Medium`, with a subtle overlap or gradient at the intersection.\n    *   **Usage:** This logo will be present in the header of the interface, serving as a subtle reminder of the looping nature of the execution.\n\n5.  **UI Layout & Flow Design:**\n    *   **Overall Structure:** A clean, card-based or sectioned layout. The interface will be divided into logical areas for monitoring the loop status, controlling execution, and viewing stage-specific information.\n    *   **Key Components:**\n        *   **Header:** Contains the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' logo, and perhaps a global status indicator (e.g., 'Looping', 'Paused', 'Complete').\n        *   **Control Panel:** Prominent buttons for 'Start Loop', 'Pause Loop', 'Reset Loop'. These will use the `Cyan-Dark` and `Amber` accent for clear affordance.\n        *   **Loop Progress Visualization:** A dynamic visual element (e.g., a progress bar with subtle animation, or a circular progress indicator) showing the current iteration and overall progress. This uses `Cyan-Medium` and `Orange` for active states.\n        *   **Stage Monitor:** A section displaying the current active stage ('La Metta', 'Dima', etc.) with its status (e.g., 'Pending', 'Executing', 'Completed', 'Error'). Each stage might be represented by a card or a distinct row.\n        *   **Details/Logs Area:** A collapsible section to view input/output details or execution logs for the current or previous stages, using `Open Sans` for readability.\n    *   **Minimally Natural Aesthetic:**\n        *   **Borders & Spacing:** Soft, subtle borders or simply generous whitespace to create separation. Avoid harsh lines. Use rounded corners on cards and buttons.\n        *   **Backgrounds:** Light, muted backgrounds (`Cyan-Light` or a very light grey/off-white) to create an airy feel. Deeper `Dark-Slate` for text areas.\n        *   **Animations:** Subtle, fluid animations for transitions between states, progress updates, and button interactions, mimicking natural movements.\n    *   **Accessibility Focus:**\n        *   **Clear Hierarchy:** Logical flow from controls to monitoring to details.\n        *   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard.\n        *   **ARIA Labels:** Implement ARIA attributes for screen reader users, especially for dynamic status updates and controls.\n        *   **Visual Cues:** Use color, icons, and text labels to convey status information, ensuring color is not the sole indicator.\n\n**UI Flow Example (Starting a Loop):**\n\n1.  User lands on the interface. Default state shows 'Ready to Start'.\n2.  User clicks the 'Start Loop' button (prominent `Cyan-Dark`).\n3.  Button visually confirms activation (e.g., slight press effect). Control Panel might disable 'Start' and enable 'Pause'/'Reset'.\n4.  Loop Progress Visualization updates to show 'Loop 1/N' and begins animating.\n5.  Stage Monitor highlights the first stage (e.g., 'La Metta') and its status changes to 'Executing' (using `Orange` or a dynamic accent).\n6.  Optional: Details/Logs area might auto-expand or show initial input requirements for 'La Metta'.\n\nThis design aims to create an intuitive, calming, yet effective interface that supports the dynamic looping execution of 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' while adhering to principles of accessibility and visual harmony.",
