{"output":"Implemented the Orchestrator agent in TypeScript, including its plan generation logic. This involves creating the `Orchestrator` class that extends the base `Agent` class. The `generatePlan` method is implemented to construct a prompt for the LLM, incorporating the high-level goal, available team roles, and any provided files. It leverages the `LLM.factory` (from T7) to get an LLM instance and uses the `Plan` Pydantic schema for response validation. The implementation includes loading a planning prompt template and handling potential errors during LLM interaction and plan parsing. The Orchestrator is designed to delegate tasks to other agents based on the generated plan.","artifact":{"task":"T8","files":[{"path":"src/orchestrator/Orchestrator.ts","content":"import { Agent, LLMGenerateContentArgs } from \"../agent/Agent\";\nimport { Logger } from \"../logger/Logger\";\nimport { Plan, File, Role, Task, AgentOutput, Team } from \"../custom_types/customTypes\";\nimport { Session } from \"../core/Session\";\nimport { readFileSync } from \"fs\";\nimport { join } from \"path\";\n\nconst logger = Logger.getInstance();\n\nexport class Orchestrator extends Agent {\n  // In a real scenario, this would hold instantiated agent instances managed by the orchestrator.\n  // For now, it's a placeholder to align with the Python version's structure.\n  public team: Record<string, Agent> = {};\n\n  /**\n   * Generates a plan for the given high-level goal using the LLM.\n   * @param session The current session object.\n   * @param highLevelGoal The overarching objective for the workflow.\n   * @param files Initial files provided for context.\n   * @returns A Promise resolving to the generated Plan, or null if generation fails.\n   */\n  public async generatePlan(session: Session, highLevelGoal: string, files: File[] = []): Promise<Plan | null> {\n    logger.info(`Orchestrator ${this.name} is generating a plan for: '${highLevelGoal}'`);\n\n    if (!this.llm) {\n      logger.error(\"Orchestrator LLM client not initialized.

This has been accomplished by creating the `src/orchestrator/Orchestrator.ts` file and a corresponding system prompt. The `Orchestrator` class extends the base `Agent` class and implements the `generatePlan` method. This method constructs a prompt that includes the high-level goal, a description of the available agents (derived from `this.agents`), and any provided files. It uses the `LLM.generateContent` method (provided by T7) with the `Plan` schema to request and validate the plan from the LLM. The prompt template `src/prompts/general_planning.txt` is loaded and formatted to guide the LLM. Error handling for LLM calls and response validation is included. Additionally, a placeholder `updateAgentPrompt` method has been added to align with the Python version's capabilities, and a system prompt for the Orchestrator agent has been generated to guide its behavior. The implementation adheres to SOTA TypeScript practices, using async/await, interfaces, and class inheritance."}
