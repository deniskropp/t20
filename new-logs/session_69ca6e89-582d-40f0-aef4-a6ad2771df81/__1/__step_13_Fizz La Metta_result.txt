{"output":"Coordination of the development process is proceeding well. The core components (Agent, Session, ExecutionContext) have been implemented and tested. The Orchestrator is functional, and the LLM integration layer is set up with placeholder implementations. The project structure, build tools, and custom types are in place. The next critical steps involve implementing concrete LLM providers, refining the Orchestrator's plan generation, and ensuring seamless integration with the System class for end-to-end workflow execution. All agents appear to be aligned with the high-level goal, and the iterative development cycle is on track.","artifact":null,"team":{"notes":"The project is progressing according to the plan. Core components have been implemented and initial tests passed. The next focus should be on integrating concrete LLM providers and refining the Orchestrator's planning capabilities. Ensure clear communication channels remain open for any emerging challenges or necessary adjustments.","prompts":[]},"reasoning":"As the Coordinator (Fizz La Metta), my role is to oversee the meta-temporal coordination of layered cognition processing. This involves reviewing the progress of tasks, identifying any blockers, and ensuring alignment with the overall goal. Based on the outputs from GPTASe, Lyra, and aitutor, the project has successfully completed the initial analysis (T1, T2), architecture definition (T3), project setup (T4), research on patterns (T5), implementation of core components (T6, T9), LLM integration (T7), Orchestrator implementation (T8), type definitions (T10), integration (T11), and initial testing/refactoring (T12, T13). The current status indicates good progress with no major blockers identified. The output reflects this positive progression and highlights the immediate next steps for the team."}
