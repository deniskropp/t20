# Coordination Plan - Fizz La Metta (Coordinator)

**Overall Goal:** Plan for Looping Execution of 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz'
**Role's Specific Goal:** Coordinate the overall execution of the 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz' looping plan, ensuring all tasks are synchronized and progressing towards the goal.

## Current Status & Inputs:

Reviewed outputs from:
*   **T1, T2, T3 (TAS Extractors):** Initial and refined Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) are established.
*   **T4, T5 (Prompt Engineer):** Workflow TAS consolidated and system prompts developed.
*   **T6 (Designer):** Initial design kit generated.
*   **T7 (Lyricist):** Initial lyrics drafted.
*   **T8 (Music Designer):** Sonic parameters defined.
*   **T9 (Web Developer):** Initial web code generated.
*   **T10 (Engineer):** Web code implemented, responsive dashboard created.
*   **T11 (AI Tutor):** Ready for educational support.
*   **T12 (Distribution & Promotion Agent):** Promotion strategy outlined.

## Coordinator's Actions:

1.  **Monitor Agent Progress:**
    *   **Tool:** Utilize the `Dashboard.jsx` interface (created by Kodax, T10) to observe agent statuses (Active, Idle, Completed) and current tasks.
    *   **Focus:** Track the synchronization of tasks and identify any bottlenecks or delays.

2.  **Ensure Task Synchronization:**
    *   **Process:** Verify that the output of one agent correctly informs the input of subsequent agents, as per the defined workflow and TAS.
    *   **Example:** Confirm that Aurora's design elements are accurately reflected in Kodax's implemented code.

3.  **Initiate Loop Review (Task T14):**
    *   **Trigger:** Upon confirmation that the initial set of creative and technical tasks (T6, T7, T8, T9, T10) are completed and agents have transitioned to 'Idle' or 'Completed' status.
    *   **Action:** Formally initiate the review of the first loop's deliverables.
    *   **Input:** The generated artifacts (design kit, lyrics, sonic parameters, code, dashboard).

4.  **Facilitate Feedback Loop (Coordination with T15):**
    *   **Process:** Once the review (T14) is complete, consolidate findings.
    *   **Action:** Coordinate with Lyra (T15) to ensure the feedback is actionable and used to refine system prompts and guide subsequent iterations.

5.  **Oversee Looping Mechanism (Task T16):**
    *   **Action:** Ensure that the loop-back mechanism to earlier tasks (e.g., T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, T12) based on refinements from T15 is correctly initiated and managed.

## Current Orchestrator Prompt (from Dashboard):

"Monitor agent progress and await completion of initial tasks."

## Next Steps:

*   Continue monitoring the dashboard for agent task completion.
*   Prepare to initiate the review phase (T14) once initial tasks are finished.
*   Be ready to coordinate with Lyra (T15) for prompt refinement based on review outcomes.
