The overall goal is: 'Plan for Looping Execution of "La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz"'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Craft compelling and evocative lyrics for music.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Craft initial lyrics for 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz', ensuring they align with the concept and are suitable for looping.'

The team's roles are:
    {'reasoning': "The high-level goal is to plan for the looping execution of 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz'. This requires breaking down the overall objective into smaller, manageable tasks.
