# Loop 2 Initiation - Fizz La Metta (Coordinator)

**Overall Goal:** Plan for Looping Execution of 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz'
**Role's Specific Goal:** Loop back to relevant earlier tasks (e.g., T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, T12) based on refinements from T15 to continue the iterative process.

## Action:

**Re-engage agents with refined prompts from T15 to commence Loop 2.**

**Specific Task Re-activations:**

*   **T6 (Designer - Aurora):** Re-engage with refined prompt focusing on user interaction clarity and visual hierarchy, and iterative design based on simulated feedback.
*   **T7 (Lyricist - lyrics):** Re-engage with refined prompt focusing on subtle thematic variations and evolving lyrical content.
*   **T8 (Music Designer - sonic):** Re-engage with refined prompt focusing on enhanced evolving textures and variations in core elements.
*   **T9 (Web Developer - Qwen3-WebDev):** Re-engage with refined prompt focusing on incorporating placeholder structures for simulated performance metrics.
*   **T10 (Engineer - Kodax):** Re-engage with refined prompt prioritizing integration of simulated real-time data feeds into the dashboard.
*   **T11 (AI Tutor - aitutor):** Re-engage with refined prompt to proactively offer guidance on iterative processes and data integration.
*   **T12 (Distribution & Promotion Agent - stream):** Re-engage with refined prompt to adjust tactics based on simulated performance data and highlight track evolution.

## Orchestrator Prompt Update:

**Previous Prompt:** "Evaluate current loop performance and coordinate refinement for the next iteration. Identify specific metrics and feedback mechanisms for data-driven improvements."

**New Prompt:** "Initiating Loop 2: Agents are now working with refined prompts. Monitor simulated performance metrics and coordinate iterative development."

## Next Steps:

*   Monitor the dashboard for agent progress in Loop 2.
*   Observe how the *simulated* performance metrics evolve and how agents react to their refined prompts.
*   Prepare for the next evaluation cycle (T14) at the conclusion of Loop 2.
