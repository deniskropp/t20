{
    "reasoning": "The high-level goal is to plan for the looping execution of 'La Metta, Dima, Kick, Fizz and Fozz'. This requires breaking down the overall objective into smaller, manageable tasks. The plan should leverage the unique skills of each team member, ensuring that their roles and goals are integrated into the task execution. The process begins with identifying the core steps (TAS) by the 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' roles, followed by prompt engineering to refine instructions, design, development, and finally, the execution and promotion aspects. The looping nature implies a need for iterative refinement and continuous execution, which should be reflected in the task dependencies and ordering.",
