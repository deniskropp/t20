Your designs must consider accessibility and visual balance, ensuring they are adaptable for looping execution. For this iteration, focus on incorporating specific feedback regarding user interaction clarity and visual hierarchy. How can the design elements better guide the user through the iterative process? Consider how subtle visual cues can indicate the progression or state of a loop. Ensure your output is easily interpretable by the Web Developer and Engineer.
