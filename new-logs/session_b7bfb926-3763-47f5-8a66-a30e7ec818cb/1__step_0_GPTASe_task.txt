The overall goal is: 'Higher Self'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Identify and extract initial Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) towards the high-level goal 'Higher Self'.'

The team's roles are:
    {'reasoning': "The high-level goal is 'Higher Self'. To achieve this, we need to break down the goal into actionable steps. The 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' agents (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe) are tasked with identifying these steps. Lyra, the Prompt Engineer, will refine the instructions for these agents. Kodax, the Engineer, and Aurora, the Designer, will be involved in implementation and design respectively, though their specific tasks will depend on the TAS identified. aitutor will facilitate knowledge transfer. fizzlametta's role is currently unknown and needs clarification, but for now, we will assume it's a placeholder and not assign it a task.", 'roles': [{'title': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'description': 'Identifies and extracts Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) towards a high-level goal.'}, {'title': 'Prompt Engineer', 'description': 'Structures workflows and ensures clarity in agent instructions and system prompt engineering.'}, {'title': 'Engineer', 'description': 'Implements designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.'}, {'title': 'Designer', 'description': 'Generates aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.'}, {'title': 'AI Tutor', 'description': 'Facilitates knowledge transfer between agents.'}], 'tasks': [{'task_id': 'T1', 'task': "Identify and extract initial Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) towards the high-level goal 'Higher Self'.", 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'GPTASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T2', 'task': "Identify and extract initial Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) towards the high-level goal 'Higher Self'.", 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'TASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T3', 'task': "Identify and extract initial Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) towards the high-level goal 'Higher Self'.", 'role': 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor', 'name': 'uTASe', 'requires': []}, {'task_id': 'T4', 'task': "Refine the system prompts for the TAS extractor agents (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe) to ensure clarity and effectiveness in identifying steps towards 'Higher Self'.", 'role': 'Prompt Engineer', 'name': 'Lyra', 'requires': ['T1', 'T2', 'T3']}, {'task_id': 'T5', 'task': 'Consolidate and synthesize the TAS identified by GPTASe, TASe, and uTASe, and present them for further refinement.', 'role': 'AI Tutor', 'name': 'aitutor', 'requires': ['T1', 'T2', 'T3']}, {'task_id': 'T6', 'task': "Based on the synthesized TAS, define the initial design requirements and user flows for achieving 'Higher Self'.", 'role': 'Designer', 'name': 'Aurora', 'requires': ['T5']}, {'task_id': 'T7', 'task': 'Based on the synthesized TAS, define the initial technical architecture and implementation plan.', 'role': 'Engineer', 'name': 'Kodax', 'requires': ['T5']}]}
