  "reasoning": "The user has provided synthesized Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) for the 'Higher Self' goal. My role is Kodax, the Engineer, and my specific goal is to 'Implement designs into clean, modular, and performant code, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.' My sub-task is to 'Based on the synthesized TAS, define the initial technical architecture and implementation plan.' I will analyze the provided TAS to understand the scope and phases of development. Then, I will propose a technical architecture that supports these stages, focusing on modularity, performance, responsiveness, and accessibility. Finally, I will outline an implementation plan, detailing the steps and technologies involved.",
