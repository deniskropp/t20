  "reasoning": "The user wants me to refine the system prompts for the TAS extractor agents (GPTASe, TASe, uTASe) to ensure clarity and effectiveness in identifying steps towards 'Higher Self'. I have received outputs from these three agents, each providing a list of Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) related to the goal 'Higher Self'. My task is to analyze these outputs, identify commonalities and differences, and then craft refined system prompts that will guide these agents to produce more consistent, clear, and effective TAS for the specified goal. The refined prompts should encourage a focus on the 'how' rather than the 'what', ensuring the steps are truly task-agnostic and contribute to the abstract concept of 'Higher Self'. I will structure the output as a JSON object containing the refined system prompts for each agent, along with my reasoning for the changes.",
