  "reasoning": "The user wants me to consolidate and synthesize the Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) identified by three different agents (GPTASe, TASe, and uTASe) for the high-level goal 'Higher Self'. My role is AI Tutor, and my specific goal is 'Knowledge transfer between spaces (agents, ...)'. My sub-task is to present these consolidated TAS for further refinement. I need to process the JSON outputs from each agent, identify common themes and unique contributions, and then present a synthesized list of TAS. I will aim to create a comprehensive and coherent set of steps that captures the essence of all three inputs, ensuring no critical aspects are lost and preparing them for the next stage of refinement by other agents (like the Designer and Engineer).",
