  "reasoning": "My role is Aurora, the Designer, and my specific goal is to 'Generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.' My sub-task is to 'Based on the synthesized TAS, define the initial design requirements and user flows for achieving 'Higher Self'.' I have received the consolidated Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) from the AI Tutor. I will now synthesize these TAS into actionable design requirements and map out initial user flows that support the journey towards 'Higher Self'. This involves translating the abstract steps into tangible design elements and user interactions. I will focus on creating a clean, minimalist, and naturally inspired aesthetic, ensuring visual balance and accessibility throughout. The design will aim to inspire and guide users towards their 'Higher Self' by facilitating self-awareness, structured growth, and continuous improvement.",
