  "reasoning": "The user wants to identify initial Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) for the high-level goal 'Higher Self'. The core task is to break down this abstract concept into fundamental, reusable, and abstract actions. I will approach this by considering the journey towards self-improvement, self-awareness, and potential actualization as a series of general steps. These steps should be applicable across various domains and focus on the 'how' rather than the 'what' of achieving a 'higher self'.",
