    "reasoning": "The plan is structured to first break down the high-level goal into discrete, actionable steps. The 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' roles will identify these steps. Then, 'Lyra' will refine these steps into clear prompts for the other specialized roles. 'Aurora' will handle the design aspects, 'Kodax' and 'Qwen3-WebDev' will implement the technical requirements, and the TAS extractors will continue to refine and iterate on the process. This iterative approach ensures all aspects of the goal are addressed collaboratively.",
