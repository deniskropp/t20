      "content": "# Prompt Engineering Guidelines for YouTube Short Script Generation (Co-evolutionary Greetings)\n\nThese guidelines are designed to assist the script generation agent (Qwen3-WebDev) in creating a compelling and effective YouTube Short script based on the provided outline.\n\n## Core Principles:\n\n1.  **Conciseness is Key:** Every word counts. Prioritize brevity and impact. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it immediately in simple terms.\n2.  **Visual Storytelling:** Remember this is for a visual medium. Write with the visuals in mind. Suggest dynamic shots, clear actions, and engaging imagery.\n3.  **Hook Emphasis:** The first 5 seconds are critical. Ensure the opening is attention-grabbing and clearly introduces the topic or poses an intriguing question.\n4.  **Pacing:** Maintain a fast, energetic pace throughout. Use short sentences and quick transitions.\n5.  **Clarity:** Explain complex concepts (like co-evolution) using simple language and relatable analogies.\n6.  **Format Adherence:** Strictly adhere to the YouTube Shorts format (< 60 seconds, vertical aspect ratio).\n\n## Prompt Structure for Script Generation:\n\nWhen prompting the script generation agent, include the following elements:\n\n*   **Role:** \"You are a scriptwriter specializing in creating engaging, short-form educational content for YouTube.\"\n*   **Goal:** \"Generate a script for a YouTube Short (under 60 seconds) explaining the concept of co-evolutionary greetings.\"\n*   **Input Data:** Provide the `youtube_short_script_outline.json` file, highlighting:\n    *   The `title`, `logline`, and `target_audience`.\n    *   The specific `constraints` (duration, platform, aspect ratio, hook time, pacing).\n    *   The detailed `narrative_arc` breakdown (segment, time estimate, content points, visual suggestions).\n    *   The `core_concepts` and `key_information_points` that MUST be included.\n*   **Specific Instructions:**\n    *   \"Develop dialogue that is conversational, clear, and suitable for a general audience.\"\n    *   \"Integrate the `visual_suggestions` directly into the script, indicating where they should occur.\"\n    *   \"Ensure the hook (first 5 seconds) is highly engaging and clearly sets up the topic.\"\n    *   \"Maintain a consistent, fast-paced rhythm throughout the script.\"\n    *   \"Incorporate a clear call to action or thought-provoking question at the end.\"\n    *   \"Format the output as a script with distinct sections for VISUALS and AUDIO/VOICEOVER.\"\n    *   \"Keep the total spoken word count appropriate for a < 60-second video (approx. 120-150 words).\n*   **Tone:** \"Enthusiastic, curious, and informative.\"\n\n## Example Snippet for Agent Instruction:\n\n```\nGenerate a script for a YouTube Short based on the provided outline. Focus on a fast pace and clear explanations. The script should be under 150 words and include distinct visual and audio cues. Ensure the first 5 seconds grab attention and introduce the concept of 'co-evolutionary greetings'.\n```\n\n## Iteration Notes:\n\n*   Be prepared to refine the script based on feedback regarding clarity, pacing, and engagement.\n*   Ensure scientific accuracy while maintaining simplicity.\n*   Prioritize visual descriptions that are easy to imagine or animate.\n"
