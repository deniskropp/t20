  "reasoning": "The sub-task is to assign initial roles to team members based on the defined roles and their names, ensuring alignment with the high-level goal. The output from Task T001 (1__step_0_LaArchitect_result.txt) provides the defined roles. I need to map the provided team member names (which are not explicitly given in the prompt but implied by the task list's 'name' fields) to these roles. I will use the 'name' field from the task definitions to assign specific individuals to roles where a direct mapping is evident or inferable. Since the prompt only provides the *list* of roles and *tasks* with associated names, but not a explicit list of *team members* to assign to those roles, I will assign the names provided in the task list to the corresponding roles as the initial assignment.",
