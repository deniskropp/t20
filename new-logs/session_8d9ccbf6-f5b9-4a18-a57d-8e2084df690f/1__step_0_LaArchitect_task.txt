The overall goal is: 'Higher Self'

Your role's specific goal is: ''
Your specific sub-task is: 'Define the initial set of roles and their core responsibilities based on the provided team member list and the high-level goal 'Higher Self'.'

The team's roles are:
    {'reasoning': "The initial step is to define the roles of each team member based on their names and the overall high-level goal of 'Higher Self'. This involves understanding how each role contributes to the iterative development of a plan. Subsequently, tasks will be defined to operationalize these roles, starting with foundational steps like understanding the high-level goal and defining initial roles. The process will be iterative, with each task building upon the previous ones to refine the plan and the system prompts for each agent.", 'roles': [{'title': 'System Architect', 'description': 'Oversees the overall system design, architecture, and integration of components.
