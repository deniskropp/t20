  "reasoning": "The sub-task is to identify and extract the first set of Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) required to begin the iterative development process towards the 'Higher Self' goal. The 'System Architect' has already defined the roles and responsibilities. The next logical step is to understand the high-level goal itself, which is a foundational step for any development process. Therefore, 'Define High-Level Goal' is a suitable first TAS. Following that, understanding the context and the roles involved is crucial, leading to 'Analyze Context' and 'Define Roles'. Given the iterative nature, 'Plan Iteration' is also a necessary early step. Finally, to start the process of decomposition, 'Initiate Decomposition' is a fitting TAS.",
