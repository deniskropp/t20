  "thinking": "The user wants me to consolidate and refine the Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) extracted by the previous agents (T1, T2, T3) into a single, coherent list. My role is Prompt Engineer, and my specific goal is to structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions. Therefore, the output should be a unified JSON array of TAS, ensuring consistency in format and content across all extracted steps. I will compare the outputs from T1, T2, and T3, identify any overlaps or discrepancies, and produce a final, clean list of TAS that best represents the abstract steps needed for the overall goal. All three agents produced very similar, if not identical, lists of TAS. I will use the output from T2 as the base and ensure it is formatted correctly according to the schema.",
  "output": "Consolidated and refined Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) for 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta':\n\n1.  **Define Creative Constraints:** Establish the specific thematic, stylistic, and structural boundaries for the creative project. This involves identifying the core subject matter ('Fizz La Metta'), desired genre ('Orchestral-SpeedCore'), and any specific requirements or limitations that will guide the creation process.\n2.  **Develop Thematic Content:** Generate the core ideas, narratives, messages, or lyrical concepts that will form the basis of the creative output. This involves brainstorming and outlining the substance of the work, specifically focusing on themes related to 'Fizz La Metta'.\n3.  **Define Stylistic Elements:** Identify and specify the characteristic aesthetic, sonic, or visual attributes that define the project's unique style. This includes elements like instrumentation (orchestral), genre fusion (SpeedCore), and overall sonic palette.\n4.  **Structure Composition:** Organize the temporal or spatial arrangement of elements within the creative work, defining its flow, progression, and sectional components (e.g., intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro).\n5.  **Integrate Content and Style:** Combine the developed thematic content (lyrics) with the defined stylistic elements (orchestral, SpeedCore) and structural plan into a cohesive whole, ensuring harmony between the message, aesthetics, and form.\n6.  **Refine and Polish:** Review and enhance the integrated creative output, making iterative improvements to quality, coherence, and impact. This includes editing lyrics, mixing audio, and fine-tuning all aspects of the music track.",
