  "thinking": "The user wants me to act as a 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' and identify Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) from the high-level goal: 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'.\n\nMy role's specific goal is to identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards this high-level goal.\n\nI need to break down the high-level goal into fundamental, reusable, and abstract actions. The output must be a JSON array of TAS entries, each conforming strictly to the provided schema.\n\nI will analyze the input goal: 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'.\n\n**Decomposition Process:**\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal involves creating a music track with specific genre ('Orchestral-SpeedCore'), content ('lyrics'), and subject ('Fizz La Metta').\n\n2.  **Identify Core Actions:** What are the fundamental actions needed to achieve this?\n    *   Defining the creative parameters (genre, theme, subject).\n    *   Developing the lyrical content.\n    *   Developing the musical elements (orchestral, speedcore).\n    *   Structuring the track.\n    *   Integrating lyrics and music.\n    *   Refining the final product.\n\n3.  **Abstract and Generalize:** Now, I'll rephrase these actions to be domain-agnostic, using the provided conceptual framework and identification criteria.\n    *   'Defining the creative parameters' -> 'Define Creative Constraints' (Covers genre, subject, style).\n    *   'Developing the lyrical content' -> 'Develop Thematic Content' (Focuses on the message/narrative).\n    *   'Developing the musical elements' -> 'Define Stylistic Elements' (Covers sonic/orchestral aspects).\n    *   'Structuring the track' -> 'Structure Composition' (Covers arrangement and flow).\n    *   'Integrating lyrics and music' -> 'Integrate Content and Style' (Combines thematic and stylistic elements).\n    *   'Refining the final product' -> 'Refine and Polish' (Iterative improvement).\n\n4.  **Populate JSON Schema:** For each identified TAS, I will create a JSON object adhering to the schema, including `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, `purpose`, and other optional fields for completeness.\n    *   **ID:** Generate UUIDs.\n    *   **Name:** Use the abstracted verb-noun phrases.\n    *   **Description:** Explain the general action and its purpose.\n    *   **Category:** Assign from the enum ('Planning', 'Analysis', 'Execution', 'Refactoring').\n    *   **Purpose:** A concise summary.\n    *   **Keywords, Applicability Notes, Examples, Inputs, Outputs:** Add relevant general information.\n\n**Self-Correction/Refinement:**\n*   The initial goal is specific to music. I need to ensure the TAS are general enough. For example, 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' is a style, so 'Define Stylistic Elements' is appropriate. 'Lyrics about Fizz La Metta' relates to content, so 'Develop Thematic Content' fits.\n*   I will ensure the descriptions and examples clearly illustrate the general nature of each step, even though the originating goal is specific.\n*   The provided output from `GPTASe` (T1) seems to have already identified some TAS. I will use these as a strong starting point and ensure my output is consistent and potentially expands upon them if necessary, or simply provides a refined version that is strictly my own output as per the prompt.\n*   Looking at the T1 output, the identified TAS are: 'Define Creative Constraints', 'Develop Thematic Content', 'Define Stylistic Elements', 'Structure Composition', 'Integrate Content and Style', 'Refine and Polish'. These align well with my own breakdown.\n*   I will generate my own JSON output based on these steps, ensuring it strictly follows the schema and guidelines. I will generate new UUIDs for each step.\n\n**Final Plan:** Generate a JSON array containing the TAS objects for 'Define Creative Constraints', 'Develop Thematic Content', 'Define Stylistic Elements', 'Structure Composition', 'Integrate Content and Style', and 'Refine and Polish', populating each field as per the schema and guidelines.",

  "thinking": "The user wants me to act as a 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' and identify Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) from the high-level goal: 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'.\n\nMy role's specific goal is to identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards this high-level goal.\n\nI need to break down the high-level goal into fundamental, reusable, and abstract actions. The output must be a JSON array of TAS entries, each conforming strictly to the provided schema.\n\nI will analyze the input goal: 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'.\n\n**Decomposition Process:**\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal involves creating a music track with specific genre ('Orchestral-SpeedCore'), content ('lyrics'), and subject ('Fizz La Metta').\n\n2.  **Identify Core Actions:** What are the fundamental actions needed to achieve this?\n    *   Defining the creative parameters (genre, theme, subject).\n    *   Developing the lyrical content.\n    *   Developing the musical elements (orchestral, speedcore).\n    *   Structuring the track.\n    *   Integrating lyrics and music.\n    *   Refining the final product.\n\n3.  **Abstract and Generalize:** Now, I'll rephrase these actions to be domain-agnostic, using the provided conceptual framework and identification criteria.\n    *   'Defining the creative parameters' -> 'Define Creative Constraints' (Covers genre, subject, style).\n    *   'Developing the lyrical content' -> 'Develop Thematic Content' (Focuses on the message/narrative).\n    *   'Developing the musical elements' -> 'Define Stylistic Elements' (Covers sonic/orchestral aspects).\n    *   'Structuring the track' -> 'Structure Composition' (Covers arrangement and flow).\n    *   'Integrating lyrics and music' -> 'Integrate Content and Style' (Combines thematic and stylistic elements).\n    *   'Refining the final product' -> 'Refine and Polish' (Iterative improvement).\n\n4.  **Populate JSON Schema:** For each identified TAS, I will create a JSON object adhering to the schema, including `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, and other optional fields for completeness.\n    *   **ID:** Generate UUIDs.\n    *   **Name:** Use the abstracted verb-noun phrases.\n    *   **Description:** Explain the general action and its purpose.\n    *   **Category:** Assign from the enum ('Planning', 'Analysis', 'Execution', 'Refactoring').\n    *   **Purpose:** A concise summary.\n    *   **Keywords, Applicability Notes, Examples, Inputs, Outputs:** Add relevant general information.\n\n**Self-Correction/Refinement:**\n*   The initial goal is specific to music. I need to ensure the TAS are general enough. For example, 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' is a style, so 'Define Stylistic Elements' is appropriate. 'Lyrics about Fizz La Metta' relates to content, so 'Develop Thematic Content' fits.\n*   I will ensure the descriptions and examples clearly illustrate the general nature of each step, even though the originating goal is specific.\n*   The provided output from `GPTASe` (T1) and `TASe` (T2) seem to have already identified some TAS. I will use these as a strong starting point and ensure my output is consistent and potentially expands upon them if necessary, or simply provides a refined version that is strictly my own output as per the prompt.\n*   Looking at the T1 and T2 outputs, the identified TAS are: 'Define Creative Constraints', 'Develop Thematic Content', 'Define Stylistic Elements', 'Structure Composition', 'Integrate Content and Style', 'Refine and Polish'. These align well with my own breakdown.\n*   I will generate my own JSON output based on these steps, ensuring it strictly follows the schema and guidelines. I will generate new UUIDs for each step.\n\n**Final Plan:** Generate a JSON array containing the TAS objects for 'Define Creative Constraints', 'Develop Thematic Content', 'Define Stylistic Elements', 'Structure Composition', 'Integrate Content and Style', and 'Refine and Polish', populating each field as per the schema and guidelines.",

I have received the consolidated Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) and the lyrical themes and narrative for 'Fizz La Metta'. My current task (T6) requires me to define the sonic palette and orchestral elements, ensuring they align with the lyrical themes and the 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' genre. I need to output this definition in a structured format, likely a JSON object describing the sonic characteristics.",
  "output": "## Sonic Palette and Orchestral Elements for 'Orchestral-SpeedCore: Fizz La Metta'\n\nThis document outlines the sonic palette and orchestral elements designed to embody the 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' genre and align with the lyrical themes of 'Fizz La Metta', which explore chaotic energy, grandeur, decay, and the thrill of the edge.\n\n**1. Core Sonic Identity:**\n\n*   **Genre Fusion:** A high-energy, aggressive 'SpeedCore' foundation layered with rich, dramatic 'Orchestral' elements. The contrast between the synthetic, relentless drive of SpeedCore and the organic, complex textures of an orchestra is key.\n*   **Mood:** Intense, exhilarating, epic, chaotic, with underlying themes of grandeur and potential decay. A sense of high-stakes drama and relentless forward momentum.\n*   **Tempo:** Predominantly fast, in the range of 180-250 BPM, characteristic of SpeedCore, but with potential for dramatic tempo shifts or perceived shifts through rhythmic density.\n\n**2. Orchestral Elements:**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To provide scale, drama, emotional depth, and a sense of 'epicness'. They will contrast with and sometimes be overwhelmed by the SpeedCore elements.\n*   **Instrumentation:**\n    *   **Strings:** Full string section (violins, violas, cellos, double basses) providing sweeping melodic lines, urgent ostinatos, and dramatic stabs. High-pitched strings might carry intense, fast melodic fragments, while low strings provide a dark, rumbling foundation.\n    *   **Brass:** Powerful brass section (horns, trumpets, trombones, tuba) for fanfares, heroic motifs, aggressive punctuation, and dark, ominous textures. Trombones and tuba can add weight to the low end.\n    *   **Woodwinds:** Used more sparingly for color, texture, and specific melodic flourishes. Flutes and piccolos can add a piercing, frantic quality; clarinets and oboes for more melancholic or dissonant passages.\n    *   **Percussion:** Timpani for dramatic rolls and impacts, large orchestral bass drums for epic hits, cymbals for crashes and accents. These will often sync with or augment the SpeedCore drum patterns.\n*   **Arrangement Style:** Dramatic, often employing rapid arpeggios, powerful fanfares, dissonant harmonies, and sudden dynamic shifts. Orchestral parts should sometimes feel 'out of control' or fighting against the SpeedCore elements.\n\n**3. SpeedCore Elements:**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To provide the relentless energy, aggression, and driving force of the track.\n*   **Instrumentation:**\n    *   **Drums:** Heavily distorted kick drums (often a double or quad-kick pattern), fast snare rolls, aggressive hi-hats, and complex, rapid percussion patterns. Emphasis on rhythmic intensity and power.\n    *   **Synths:** Distorted, aggressive lead synths carrying fast, often atonal or dissonant melodies. Dark, atmospheric pads for underlying tension. Aggressive bass synths providing a powerful, driving low-end.\n    *   **Samples:** Glitchy, distorted, and processed vocal chops or environmental sounds to add texture and chaos.\n*   **Arrangement Style:** Relentless, high-frequency focus, characterized by rapid repetition, complex rhythmic programming, and extreme distortion.\n\n**4. Sonic Textures and Effects:**\n\n*   **Distortion & Saturation:** Applied heavily to drums, synths, and even some orchestral elements (e.g., strings treated with aggressive saturation) to achieve the raw, powerful SpeedCore sound.\n*   **Reverb & Delay:** Used to create a sense of vast space (epic orchestral feel) but also for chaotic, disorienting effects (delay throws, modulated reverbs).\n*   **Compression:** Heavy compression on drums and bass for maximum impact and punch.\n*   **Automation:** Extensive use of volume, filter, and effect automation to create dynamic movement, build tension, and emphasize transitions.\n*   **Sound Design:** Incorporating unique sound effects that blend orchestral and synthetic sources – e.g., a distorted cello sample, a synthesized orchestral hit.\n\n**5. Lyrical Alignment:**\n\n*   **Energy/Chaos:** SpeedCore drums and synths, rapid string ostinatos, frantic woodwind passages.\n*   **Grandeur/Decay:** Full orchestral sections, powerful brass fanfares, deep timpani rolls, contrasted with moments where these elements are broken, distorted, or abruptly cut off.\n*   **Thrill/Edge:** Fast tempos, aggressive rhythms, sharp dynamic contrasts, dissonant harmonies, high-pitched piercing sounds.\n*   **Obsession/Addiction:** Repetitive motifs (both orchestral and synthetic), driving basslines, a sense of being trapped in a loop.\n*   **Transformation:** Dramatic shifts in instrumentation, tempo, and dynamics; use of build-ups and breakdowns.\n\n**6. Output Format:**\n\nThis definition will be structured in a JSON format for clarity and integration into subsequent production steps.",
