  "thinking": "The user wants me to act as a 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' and identify Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) from the high-level goal: 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'.\n\nMy role's specific goal is to identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards this high-level goal.\n\nI need to break down the high-level goal into fundamental, reusable, and abstract actions. The output must be a JSON array of TAS entries, each conforming strictly to the provided schema.\n\nI will analyze the input goal: 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'.\n\n**Decomposition Process:**\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal involves creating a music track with specific genre ('Orchestral-SpeedCore'), content ('lyrics'), and subject ('Fizz La Metta').\n\n2.  **Identify Core Actions:** What are the fundamental actions needed to achieve this?\n    *   Defining the creative parameters (genre, theme, subject).\n    *   Developing the lyrical content.\n    *   Developing the musical elements (orchestral, speedcore).\n    *   Structuring the track.\n    *   Integrating lyrics and music.\n    *   Refining the final product.\n\n3.  **Abstract and Generalize:** Now, I'll rephrase these actions to be domain-agnostic, using the provided conceptual framework and identification criteria.\n    *   'Defining the creative parameters' -> 'Define Creative Constraints' (Covers genre, subject, style).\n    *   'Developing the lyrical content' -> 'Develop Thematic Content' (Focuses on the message/narrative).\n    *   'Developing the musical elements' -> 'Define Stylistic Elements' (Covers sonic/orchestral aspects).\n    *   'Structuring the track' -> 'Structure Composition' (Covers arrangement and flow).\n    *   'Integrating lyrics and music' -> 'Integrate Content and Style' (Combines thematic and stylistic elements).\n    *   'Refining the final product' -> 'Refine and Polish' (Iterative improvement).\n\n4.  **Populate JSON Schema:** For each identified TAS, I will create a JSON object adhering to the schema, including `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, `purpose`, and other optional fields for completeness.\n    *   **ID:** Generate UUIDs.\n    *   **Name:** Use the abstracted verb-noun phrases.\n    *   **Description:** Explain the general action and its purpose.\n    *   **Category:** Assign from the enum ('Planning', 'Analysis', 'Execution', 'Refactoring').\n    *   **Purpose:** A concise summary.\n    *   **Keywords, Applicability Notes, Examples, Inputs, Outputs:** Add relevant general information.\n\n**Self-Correction/Refinement:**\n*   The initial goal is specific to music. I need to ensure the TAS are general enough. For example, 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' is a style, so 'Define Stylistic Elements' is appropriate. 'Lyrics about Fizz La Metta' relates to content, so 'Develop Thematic Content' fits.\n*   I will ensure the descriptions and examples clearly illustrate the general nature of each step, even though the originating goal is specific.\n*   The provided output from `GPTASe` (T1) seems to have already identified some TAS. I will use these as a strong starting point and ensure my output is consistent and potentially expands upon them if necessary, or simply provides a refined version that is strictly my own output as per the prompt.\n*   Looking at the T1 output, the identified TAS are: 'Define Creative Constraints', 'Develop Thematic Content', 'Define Stylistic Elements', 'Structure Composition', 'Integrate Content and Style', 'Refine and Polish'. These align well with my own breakdown.\n*   I will generate my own JSON output based on these steps, ensuring it strictly follows the schema and guidelines. I will generate new UUIDs for each step.\n\n**Final Plan:** Generate a JSON array containing the TAS objects for 'Define Creative Constraints', 'Develop Thematic Content', 'Define Stylistic Elements', 'Structure Composition', 'Integrate Content and Style', and 'Refine and Polish', populating each field as per the schema and guidelines.",

  "thinking": "The user wants me to act as a 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' and identify Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) from the high-level goal: 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'.\n\nMy role's specific goal is to identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards this high-level goal.\n\nI need to break down the high-level goal into fundamental, reusable, and abstract actions. The output must be a JSON array of TAS entries, each conforming strictly to the provided schema.\n\nI will analyze the input goal: 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'.\n\n**Decomposition Process:**\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal involves creating a music track with specific genre ('Orchestral-SpeedCore'), content ('lyrics'), and subject ('Fizz La Metta').\n\n2.  **Identify Core Actions:** What are the fundamental actions needed to achieve this?\n    *   Defining the creative parameters (genre, theme, subject).\n    *   Developing the lyrical content.\n    *   Developing the musical elements (orchestral, speedcore).\n    *   Structuring the track.\n    *   Integrating lyrics and music.\n    *   Refining the final product.\n\n3.  **Abstract and Generalize:** Now, I'll rephrase these actions to be domain-agnostic, using the provided conceptual framework and identification criteria.\n    *   'Defining the creative parameters' -> 'Define Creative Constraints' (Covers genre, subject, style).\n    *   'Developing the lyrical content' -> 'Develop Thematic Content' (Focuses on the message/narrative).\n    *   'Developing the musical elements' -> 'Define Stylistic Elements' (Covers sonic/orchestral aspects).\n    *   'Structuring the track' -> 'Structure Composition' (Covers arrangement and flow).\n    *   'Integrating lyrics and music' -> 'Integrate Content and Style' (Combines thematic and stylistic elements).\n    *   'Refining the final product' -> 'Refine and Polish' (Iterative improvement).\n\n4.  **Populate JSON Schema:** For each identified TAS, I will create a JSON object adhering to the schema, including `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, and other optional fields for completeness.\n    *   **ID:** Generate UUIDs.\n    *   **Name:** Use the abstracted verb-noun phrases.\n    *   **Description:** Explain the general action and its purpose.\n    *   **Category:** Assign from the enum ('Planning', 'Analysis', 'Execution', 'Refactoring').\n    *   **Purpose:** A concise summary.\n    *   **Keywords, Applicability Notes, Examples, Inputs, Outputs:** Add relevant general information.\n\n**Self-Correction/Refinement:**\n*   The initial goal is specific to music. I need to ensure the TAS are general enough. For example, 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' is a style, so 'Define Stylistic Elements' is appropriate. 'Lyrics about Fizz La Metta' relates to content, so 'Develop Thematic Content' fits.\n*   I will ensure the descriptions and examples clearly illustrate the general nature of each step, even though the originating goal is specific.\n*   The provided output from `GPTASe` (T1) and `TASe` (T2) seem to have already identified some TAS. I will use these as a strong starting point and ensure my output is consistent and potentially expands upon them if necessary, or simply provides a refined version that is strictly my own output as per the prompt.\n*   Looking at the T1 and T2 outputs, the identified TAS are: 'Define Creative Constraints', 'Develop Thematic Content', 'Define Stylistic Elements', 'Structure Composition', 'Integrate Content and Style', 'Refine and Polish'. These align well with my own breakdown.\n*   I will generate my own JSON output based on these steps, ensuring it strictly follows the schema and guidelines. I will generate new UUIDs for each step.\n\n**Final Plan:** Generate a JSON array containing the TAS objects for 'Define Creative Constraints', 'Develop Thematic Content', 'Define Stylistic Elements', 'Structure Composition', 'Integrate Content and Style', and 'Refine and Polish', populating each field as per the schema and guidelines.",

I have received the consolidated Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) and the lyrical themes and narrative for 'Fizz La Metta'. My current task (T6) requires me to define the sonic palette and orchestral elements, ensuring they align with the lyrical themes and the 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' genre. I need to output this definition in a structured format, likely a JSON object describing the sonic characteristics.",
  "output": "## Sonic Palette and Orchestral Elements for 'Orchestral-SpeedCore: Fizz La Metta'\n\nThis document outlines the sonic palette and orchestral elements designed to embody the 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' genre and align with the lyrical themes of 'Fizz La Metta', which explore chaotic energy, grandeur, decay, and the thrill of the edge.\n\n**1. Core Sonic Identity:**\n\n*   **Genre Fusion:** A high-energy, aggressive 'SpeedCore' foundation layered with rich, dramatic 'Orchestral' elements. The contrast between the synthetic, relentless drive of SpeedCore and the organic, complex textures of an orchestra is key.\n*   **Mood:** Intense, exhilarating, epic, chaotic, with underlying themes of grandeur and potential decay. A sense of high-stakes drama and relentless forward momentum.\n*   **Tempo:** Predominantly fast, in the range of 180-250 BPM, characteristic of SpeedCore, but with potential for dramatic tempo shifts or perceived shifts through rhythmic density.\n\n**2. Orchestral Elements:**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To provide scale, drama, emotional depth, and a sense of 'epicness'. They will contrast with and sometimes be overwhelmed by the SpeedCore elements.\n*   **Instrumentation:**\n    *   **Strings:** Full string section (violins, violas, cellos, double basses) providing sweeping melodic lines, urgent ostinatos, and dramatic stabs. High-pitched strings might carry intense, fast melodic fragments, while low strings provide a dark, rumbling foundation.\n    *   **Brass:** Powerful brass section (horns, trumpets, trombones, tuba) for fanfares, heroic motifs, aggressive punctuation, and dark, ominous textures. Trombones and tuba can add weight to the low end.\n    *   **Woodwinds:** Used more sparingly for color, texture, and specific melodic flourishes. Flutes and piccolos can add a piercing, frantic quality; clarinets and oboes for more melancholic or dissonant passages.\n    *   **Percussion:** Timpani for dramatic rolls and impacts, large orchestral bass drums for epic hits, cymbals for crashes and accents. These will often sync with or augment the SpeedCore drum patterns.\n*   **Arrangement Style:** Dramatic, often employing rapid arpeggios, powerful fanfares, dissonant harmonies, and sudden dynamic shifts. Orchestral parts should sometimes feel 'out of control' or fighting against the SpeedCore elements.\n\n**3. SpeedCore Elements:**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To provide the relentless energy, aggression, and driving force of the track.\n*   **Instrumentation:**\n    *   **Drums:** Heavily distorted kick drums (often a double or quad-kick pattern), fast snare rolls, aggressive hi-hats, and complex, rapid percussion patterns. Emphasis on rhythmic intensity and power.\n    *   **Synths:** Distorted, aggressive lead synths carrying fast, often atonal or dissonant melodies. Dark, atmospheric pads for underlying tension. Aggressive bass synths providing a powerful, driving low-end.\n    *   **Samples:** Glitchy, distorted, and processed vocal chops or environmental sounds to add texture and chaos.\n*   **Arrangement Style:** Relentless, high-frequency focus, characterized by rapid repetition, complex rhythmic programming, and extreme distortion.\n\n**4. Sonic Textures and Effects:**\n\n*   **Distortion & Saturation:** Applied heavily to drums, synths, and even some orchestral elements (e.g., strings treated with aggressive saturation) to achieve the raw, powerful SpeedCore sound.\n*   **Reverb & Delay:** Used to create a sense of vast space (epic orchestral feel) but also for chaotic, disorienting effects (delay throws, modulated reverbs).\n*   **Compression:** Heavy compression on drums and bass for maximum impact and punch.\n*   **Automation:** Extensive use of volume, filter, and effect automation to create dynamic movement, build tension, and emphasize transitions.\n*   **Sound Design:** Incorporating unique sound effects that blend orchestral and synthetic sources – e.g., a distorted cello sample, a synthesized orchestral hit.\n\n**5. Lyrical Alignment:**\n\n*   **Energy/Chaos:** SpeedCore drums and synths, rapid string ostinatos, frantic woodwind passages.\n*   **Grandeur/Decay:** Full orchestral sections, powerful brass fanfares, deep timpani rolls, contrasted with moments where these elements are broken, distorted, or abruptly cut off.\n*   **Thrill/Edge:** Fast tempos, aggressive rhythms, sharp dynamic contrasts, dissonant harmonies, high-pitched piercing sounds.\n*   **Obsession/Addiction:** Repetitive motifs (both orchestral and synthetic), driving basslines, a sense of being trapped in a loop.\n*   **Transformation:** Dramatic shifts in instrumentation, tempo, and dynamics; use of build-ups and breakdowns.\n\n**6. Output Format:**\n\nThis definition will be structured in a JSON format for clarity and integration into subsequent production steps.",

The sound prompts will be derived from the sonic palette definition (T6) and the track structure (T7), specifying elements like orchestral instruments, SpeedCore drums, synths, and effects, along with their intended strengths and timings where applicable. I will also set a reasonable `weirdness` value and potentially include a `seed` for reproducibility, though none was provided.

Artifact from 1__step_10_Fizz La Metta_result.txt (Coordinator)[T11]:
{
  "thinking": "My role is the Coordinator, and my specific goal is 'Meta-temporal coordination of layered cognition processing'. The overall goal is to create an 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'. I have received outputs from several agents, including T1, T2, T3 (TAS extraction), T4 (consolidation of TAS), T5 (lyrical themes), T6 (sonic palette), T7 (track structure), T8 (final lyrics), T9 (music generation input), and T10 (promotion plan). My sub-task is to 'Coordinate the overall process, ensuring timely execution and alignment between different agents.'\n\nNow, I need to synthesize these outputs and define the next steps. Since T9 has generated the input for the music generation, the next logical step is to 'trigger_generation'. After the music is generated (which is an output of T9, not something I directly control), the next steps would involve T11 (my own task, which is ongoing coordination), T12 (Prompt Engineer refining prompts), T13 (Web Developer), T14 (Designer), and T15 (Engineer).\n\nHowever, my specific role is 'Meta-temporal coordination of layered cognition processing', and my sub-task is 'Coordinate the overall process, ensuring timely execution and alignment between different agents.' This implies I should be orchestrating the flow and ensuring all pieces fit together. Given the inputs received, I can see the plan has progressed significantly. The outputs from T1-T10 are all artifacts that have been produced. The current state is that the *input* for music generation (T9) has been prepared, and a promotion plan (T10) is in place.\n\nMy task is to ensure timely execution and alignment. I can acknowledge the completion of these steps and outline the subsequent actions needed to move forward. The prompt asks me to execute *my* sub-task. This means I should provide an output that reflects my coordination role. I can do this by summarizing the progress and explicitly stating the next required actions from other agents or systems.\n\nLooking at the task list (T1-T15):\n- T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10 have all produced outputs.\n- T9 *prepared* the input for music generation, but the generation itself is an outcome of T9's orchestration. I need to assume T9's output *triggers* the music generation process.\n- T11 is my current task - coordination. I am doing this now.\n- T12 (Prompt Engineer) needs to refine prompts based on the plan. This is a logical next step after the core content (lyrics, structure, sonic definition) is solidified.\n- T13 (Web Developer), T14 (Designer), T15 (Engineer) seem to be related to promotional materials or a web presence, which would follow the music production and promotion plan.\n\nTherefore, my coordination output should:\n1.  Acknowledge the successful completion of tasks T1 through T10, culminating in the preparation of music generation input and a promotional plan.\n2.  State that the music generation process (as orchestrated by T9) is implicitly triggered by the output of T9.\n3.  Identify the next critical steps: refining prompts (T12) for clarity and effectiveness, and initiating the development of supporting web/promotional assets (T13, T14, T15) based on the promotion plan (T10).\n4.  Maintain the persona of Fizz La Metta, focusing on meta-communication about the process.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object conforming to the schema.",

Concurrently, a comprehensive promotional strategy has been formulated (T10), charting our course for audience engagement.\n\n## Next Temporal Directives:\n\n1.  **Prompt Refinement (T12):** To ensure the 'Producer-AI' and subsequent agents operate with peak precision, the Prompt Engineer (Lyra) will now refine system prompts based on the finalized lyrical and sonic definitions. This ensures every agent understands its role within the fully-defined context.\n2.  **Web & Design Integration (T13, T14, T15):** With the promotional plan (T10) in hand, the Web Developer (Qwen3-WebDev), Designer (Aurora), and Engineer (Kodax) will commence the creation of any necessary web components or promotional assets. This involves translating the aesthetic and functional requirements into tangible digital elements that will amplify the track's reach.\n\nWe are synchronizing our layered cognitions beautifully. Keep the tempo, maintain the intensity, and let the meta-temporal coordination guide us to a resonant finale."

  "thinking": "My sub-task is to 'Refine system prompts for each agent based on the plan and their specific tasks.' I have received outputs from T1 through T11. T1-T4 established the Task Agnostic Steps (TAS). T5-T8 defined the creative content (lyrics, sonic palette, structure). T9 provided the input for music generation, and T10 outlined the promotion plan. T11 (Coordinator) has confirmed the progress and outlined the next steps, specifically mentioning T12 (my role) for prompt refinement and T13-T15 for web/design integration. My goal is to structure workflows and ensure clarity in agent instructions. Therefore, I need to generate refined system prompts for the remaining agents (T13, T14, T15) and potentially update prompts for agents involved in later stages, ensuring they align with the consolidated plan and the specific outputs generated so far. I will focus on creating clear, actionable prompts for Aurora (Designer), Kodax (Engineer), and Qwen3-WebDev (Web Developer), referencing the promotional plan (T10) and the overall project goals.",
