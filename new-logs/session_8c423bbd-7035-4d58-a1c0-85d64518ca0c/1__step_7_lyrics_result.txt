  "thinking": "I have been assigned the task of generating the final lyrics for the track, incorporating feedback and ensuring coherence with the music. This is the final lyrical step (T8). I have access to the lyrical themes and narrative developed in T5 ('fizz_la_metta_lyrical_themes.md') and the track structure and sonic elements defined in T6 and T7 ('sonic_palette_definition.json', 'track_structure.json'). My goal is to write the lyrics, ensuring they fit the structure, themes, and the 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' style. I will structure the lyrics according to the song sections defined in T7 (Intro, Verse 1, Chorus 1, Breakdown 1, Verse 2, Chorus 2, Bridge, Outro). I will focus on vivid imagery, strong rhythm, and evocative language that matches the intense and epic nature of the music. I will ensure the lyrics reflect the themes of chaos, energy, grandeur, and decay associated with 'Fizz La Metta'.",
