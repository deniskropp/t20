  "thinking": "The user wants me to act as the 'Distribution and Promotion Agent' and execute the sub-task 'Develop a promotional strategy and plan for the music track, including target audience and marketing channels.' This is task T10. I have received inputs from previous tasks, including the finalized lyrics (T8) and the music generation input (T9), which implies the music track is being produced or is about to be produced. My goal is to manage digital distribution, music marketing, and audience engagement. Therefore, I need to create a promotional plan that leverages the unique characteristics of the 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' genre and the 'Fizz La Metta' theme. The plan should identify the target audience, outline marketing channels, and suggest promotional activities. I will structure this plan in a clear, actionable format, including potential KPIs for measuring success.",

Marketing Channels\n\nLeverage channels where the target audience is most active and receptive:\n\n*   **Digital Music Platforms:** Spotify, Apple Music, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, YouTube Music (for streaming and sales).\n*   **Social Media:**\n    *   **TikTok & Instagram Reels:** Short, high-impact visualizers or clips showcasing the most energetic/dramatic moments of the track. Utilize relevant hashtags (#speedcore #orchestral #electronicmusic #newmusic #experimental #hardcoretechno #cinematic #gamemusic).\n    *   **YouTube:** Official audio uploads, visualizers, lyric videos, potentially short documentaries about the creation process or the 'Fizz La Metta' concept.

Share the track, behind-the-scenes content, and participate in discussions.\n    *   **Discord:** Promote in relevant music production, genre-specific, or gaming communities.\n    *   **Facebook/Twitter:** Targeted ads, community building, sharing updates.\n*   **Music Blogs & Publications:** Target specialized electronic music blogs, extreme music reviewers, and potentially gaming/film score outlets.\n*   **Streaming Playlists:** Pitch the track to curators of Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube playlists focusing on Hardcore, Speedcore, Epic Electronic, Workout Music, or Gaming Soundtracks.\n*   **Bandcamp:** Utilize its community features for direct engagement and sales.\n\n### 3. Promotional Activities & Timeline\n\n**Phase 1: Pre-Release (2-4 weeks prior)**\n\n*   **Teaser Campaign:** Release short audio/visual snippets (15-30 seconds) on TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, highlighting the dramatic orchestral intro and the intense SpeedCore drops. Use cryptic visuals related to 'Fizz La Metta'.\n*   **Behind-the-Scenes Content:** Share short clips or posts about the unique genre fusion, lyrical themes, and production process.\n*   **Announce Release Date:** Officially announce the release date across all platforms.\n*   **Pre-Save Campaign:** Encourage pre-saves on Spotify/Apple Music to boost initial algorithmic traction.\n*   **Pitch to Playlists & Blogs:** Begin outreach to relevant playlist curators and music reviewers.\n\n**Phase 2: Release Day/Week**\n\n*   **Official Release:** Distribute track across all major platforms.\n*   **Launch Announcement:** Coordinated posts across all social media channels.\n*   **YouTube Premiere:** Schedule a YouTube premiere for the official audio/visualizer.\n*   **Engage with Early Listeners:** Respond to comments, shares, and initial feedback.\n*   **Run Targeted Ads:** Initiate small ad campaigns on platforms like YouTube, Reddit, and Facebook targeting specific genre interests.\n\n**Phase 3: Post-Release (Ongoing)**\n\n*   **Performance Monitoring:** Track streaming numbers, engagement metrics, and audience demographics.\n*   **Content Amplification:** Create lyric videos, visualizers, or even fan-art showcases.\n*   **Community Engagement:** Continue interacting in relevant online communities.
