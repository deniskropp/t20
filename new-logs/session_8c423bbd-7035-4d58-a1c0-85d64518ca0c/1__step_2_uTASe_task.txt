  "thinking": "The user wants me to act as a 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' and identify Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) from the high-level goal: 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'.\n\nMy role's specific goal is to identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards this high-level goal.\n\nI need to break down the high-level goal into fundamental, reusable, and abstract actions. The output must be a JSON array of TAS entries, each conforming strictly to the provided schema.\n\nI will analyze the input goal: 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'.\n\n**Decomposition Process:**\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal involves creating a music track with specific genre ('Orchestral-SpeedCore'), content ('lyrics'), and subject ('Fizz La Metta').\n\n2.  **Identify Core Actions:** What are the fundamental actions needed to achieve this?\n    *   Defining the creative parameters (genre, theme, subject).\n    *   Developing the lyrical content.\n    *   Developing the musical elements (orchestral, speedcore).\n    *   Structuring the track.\n    *   Integrating lyrics and music.\n    *   Refining the final product.\n\n3.  **Abstract and Generalize:** Now, I'll rephrase these actions to be domain-agnostic, using the provided conceptual framework and identification criteria.\n    *   'Defining the creative parameters' -> 'Define Creative Constraints' (Covers genre, subject, style).\n    *   'Developing the lyrical content' -> 'Develop Thematic Content' (Focuses on the message/narrative).\n    *   'Developing the musical elements' -> 'Define Stylistic Elements' (Covers sonic/orchestral aspects).\n    *   'Structuring the track' -> 'Structure Composition' (Covers arrangement and flow).\n    *   'Integrating lyrics and music' -> 'Integrate Content and Style' (Combines thematic and stylistic elements).\n    *   'Refining the final product' -> 'Refine and Polish' (Iterative improvement).\n\n4.  **Populate JSON Schema:** For each identified TAS, I will create a JSON object adhering to the schema, including `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, `purpose`, and other optional fields for completeness.\n    *   **ID:** Generate UUIDs.\n    *   **Name:** Use the abstracted verb-noun phrases.\n    *   **Description:** Explain the general action and its purpose.\n    *   **Category:** Assign from the enum ('Planning', 'Analysis', 'Execution', 'Refactoring').\n    *   **Purpose:** A concise summary.\n    *   **Keywords, Applicability Notes, Examples, Inputs, Outputs:** Add relevant general information.\n\n**Self-Correction/Refinement:**\n*   The initial goal is specific to music. I need to ensure the TAS are general enough. For example, 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' is a style, so 'Define Stylistic Elements' is appropriate. 'Lyrics about Fizz La Metta' relates to content, so 'Develop Thematic Content' fits.\n*   I will ensure the descriptions and examples clearly illustrate the general nature of each step, even though the originating goal is specific.\n*   The provided output from `GPTASe` (T1) seems to have already identified some TAS. I will use these as a strong starting point and ensure my output is consistent and potentially expands upon them if necessary, or simply provides a refined version that is strictly my own output as per the prompt.\n*   Looking at the T1 output, the identified TAS are: 'Define Creative Constraints', 'Develop Thematic Content', 'Define Stylistic Elements', 'Structure Composition', 'Integrate Content and Style', 'Refine and Polish'. These align well with my own breakdown.\n*   I will generate my own JSON output based on these steps, ensuring it strictly follows the schema and guidelines. I will generate new UUIDs for each step.\n\n**Final Plan:** Generate a JSON array containing the TAS objects for 'Define Creative Constraints', 'Develop Thematic Content', 'Define Stylistic Elements', 'Structure Composition', 'Integrate Content and Style', and 'Refine and Polish', populating each field as per the schema and guidelines.",
