  "thinking": "The user wants me to act as a 'Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) extractor' and identify Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) from the high-level goal: 'Orchestral-SpeedCore track with lyrics about Fizz La Metta'. I need to break this down into abstract, domain-agnostic actions and then structure them according to the provided JSON schema. The goal is to create reusable steps applicable across different domains, avoiding specific music production terms where possible, but the core objective is music creation, so some context is unavoidable. I will focus on the process of creating a piece of creative work with specific thematic and stylistic constraints.",
