The track will explore the chaotic, exhilarating, and perhaps destructive nature of 'Fizz La Metta'. This could be interpreted as a literal character, a metaphorical force, or even a substance that induces extreme states. The 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' style suggests a juxtaposition of grand, sweeping emotions and intense, high-octane energy.
