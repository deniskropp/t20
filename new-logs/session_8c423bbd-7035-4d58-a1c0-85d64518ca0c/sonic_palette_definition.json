  "sonic_palette": {
    "genre_fusion": "High-energy SpeedCore foundation layered with rich, dramatic Orchestral elements.",

        "section": "Strings",
        "description": "Full string section (violins, violas, cellos, double basses) providing sweeping melodic lines, urgent ostinatos, and dramatic stabs. High-pitched strings for intense, fast melodic fragments; low strings for dark, rumbling foundation."

        "section": "Brass",

        "section": "Percussion",

    "arrangement_style": "Dramatic, employing rapid arpeggios, powerful fanfares, dissonant harmonies, and sudden dynamic shifts. Orchestral parts may feel 'out of control' or fight against SpeedCore elements."
