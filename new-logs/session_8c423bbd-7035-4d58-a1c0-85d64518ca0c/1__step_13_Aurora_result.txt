  "thinking": "My role is Aurora, the Designer. My specific goal is to 'Generate aesthetic layouts, color palettes, typography, and UI flows, ensuring accessibility and visual balance.' My sub-task is to 'Provide aesthetic guidance and visual elements for any associated promotional materials or web interfaces.'\n\nI have received the following relevant inputs:\n- T10: Promotional Strategy and Plan ('promotional_strategy.md'), which outlines the need for visual elements for social media, web interfaces, etc., and emphasizes the unique 'Orchestral-SpeedCore' genre and 'Fizz La Metta' theme.\n- T12: Refined System Prompts, including a detailed prompt for me (Aurora) outlining the project goals, aesthetic directives (color palette, typography, layout, imagery style, UI flow, accessibility), and deliverables (a style guide).\n- T13: Web Developer's output (index.html, style.css, script.js) for a promotional landing page. This provides a concrete example of the web component that my design guidance needs to inform and align with.\n\nMy task is to create a style guide document that details the aesthetic direction. This guide should include:\n1.  **Color Palette:** Define specific colors with HEX codes, balancing epic/grand and chaotic/intense themes.\n2.  **Typography:** Select appropriate fonts for display and body text, considering the genre fusion.\n3.  **Layout & Composition:** Describe principles for dynamic and unconventional layouts.\n4.  **Imagery/Graphics Style:** Suggest a style for visual assets.\n5.  **UI Flow:** Outline principles for web component user experience.\n6.  **Accessibility:** Reiterate the importance of accessibility.\n\nI will structure my output as a markdown file containing these elements, ensuring it provides clear guidance for the Web Developer (T13) and Engineer (T15), and aligns with the overall project vision.\n\n**Constraint Checklist & Confidence Score:**\n1. Generate valid, parseable JSON: Yes\n2. Besides scalars, boolean, and null, other values must be double-quoted: Yes\n3. Do not generate any comments inside the json block: Yes\n4. Do not generate any control token (such as \\n and \\t) at any places: Yes (Will ensure the final JSON output adheres to this, although markdown content might use them internally for readability before being embedded in JSON strings).\n5. If a user requests multiple JSON, always return a single parseable JSON array: N/A (Single JSON output requested).\n6. Do not include any extra text outside of the JSON string: Yes\n7. Follow the schema provided in the context: Yes (The schema requires `thinking`, `output`, and `files`).\n\nConfidence Score: 5/5\n\n**Mental Sandbox:**\n- I'll start by defining the color palette. Need a dark base, a grand accent (gold?), and a chaotic accent (neon pink/purple/red?). Orbitron font for titles suggests a futuristic/epic feel, Roboto Mono for body suggests tech/glitch. Layout should feel energetic - maybe asymmetrical or using sharp lines. Imagery could be abstract or thematic. I need to ensure the output is structured clearly within the markdown file.\n- The prompt for Aurora in T12 is quite detailed, so I will use that as a strong foundation for my output.\n- The web developer's output (T13) gives me a concrete example to reference. The dark background, contrasting title/subtitle, and the CTA button style are good starting points.\n\nStrategizing complete. I will now generate the JSON output containing the style guide.",
  "output": "## Aurora's Aesthetic Guidance: 'Fizz La Metta' - Orchestral-SpeedCore\n\n### 1. Overall Vision\n\nThe visual identity for 'Fizz La Metta' must embody the thrilling, high-contrast fusion of epic orchestral grandeur and raw, chaotic SpeedCore energy. It's a duality of the sublime and the destructive, the ancient and the futuristic. The aesthetic should feel intense, dramatic, and unapologetically bold, drawing inspiration from dark, futuristic landscapes, abstract representations of intense sound, and the dramatic flair of classical compositions.\n\n### 2. Color Palette\n\nA palette that balances epic scope with chaotic energy, utilizing high contrast.\n\n*   **Primary Background:** `#0a0a0a` (Deep, near-black space – representing decay, void, or the canvas for chaos)\n*   **Primary Text/Highlight:** `#e0e0e0` (Off-white/Light Gray – clean, readable, contrasts sharply with the background)\n*   **Epic Accent:** `#d4af37` (A rich, metallic Gold – signifies orchestral grandeur, power, lost glory)\n*   **Chaos Accent:** `#ff00ff` (Electric Magenta/Violet – represents raw energy, digital intensity, the 'SpeedCore' element)\n*   **Contrast/Danger Accent:** `#ff0000` (Stark Red – signifies danger, intensity, the destructive aspect of 'Fizz La Metta')\n*   **Platform Specific Accents:** (Used subtly for links)\n    *   Spotify: `#1db954` (Green)\n    *   Apple Music: `#ff2d55` (Red/Pink)\n    *   Bandcamp: `#1ea0c3` (Blue)\n    *   YouTube: `#ff0000` (Red)\n\n### 3. Typography\n\nSelected fonts to capture the genre fusion:\n\n*   **Headings & Titles (Display):** `Orbitron`, Weights: `700` (Bold). \n    *   *Rationale:* Futuristic, sharp, and geometric, evoking epic scale and digital intensity. Provides a strong, commanding presence.\n*   **Body Text & Subtitles:** `Roboto Mono`, Weights: `400` (Regular), `700` (Bold).\n    *   *Rationale:* Monospaced, technical, and slightly glitchy feel, aligning with the 'SpeedCore' and chaotic elements. Offers good readability in regular weight and impactful emphasis in bold.\n\n### 4. Layout & Composition\n\nDynamic, high-contrast, and visually engaging layouts are key:\n\n*   **Asymmetry:** Favor asymmetrical layouts to create visual tension and energy.\n*   **Sharp Angles & Lines:** Utilize sharp angles, diagonal lines, and geometric shapes rather than soft curves to convey aggression and precision.\n*   **Layering:** Employ layering of text, graphics, and background elements to create depth and complexity, mirroring the music's structure.\n*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Ensure the track title ('Fizz La Metta') and the call-to-action ('Listen Now') are the most prominent elements. Use color, size, and placement to guide the user's eye.\n*   **Negative Space:** Use dark backgrounds and strategic negative space to make key elements pop and to give a sense of vastness or void.\n\n### 5. Imagery & Graphics Style\n\nVisuals should be abstract, energetic, and thematic:\n\n*   **Style:** Blend elements of glitch art, abstract light trails, distorted geometric patterns, and nebulae-like textures. Think of visualizations of intense sound energy or cosmic phenomena.\n*   **Motifs:** Incorporate visual representations of sound waves, sharp energy bursts, fragmented orchestral elements (e.g., distorted string textures), and hints of dark, epic scale.\n*   **Avoid:** Literal or overly realistic imagery unless highly stylized. Focus on abstract representation of the *feeling* of the music.\n\n### 6. UI Flow Principles (for Web Components)\n\n*   **Immersive Entry:** The landing page should immediately establish the track's unique atmosphere.\n*   **Clear Call-to-Action:** The 'Listen Now' button must be instantly visible and accessible.\n*   **Streamlined Navigation:** If multiple components are developed (e.g., separate pages), ensure navigation is intuitive and reinforces the brand aesthetic.\n*   **Subtle Interactivity:** Use animations (e.g., background pulses, button hover effects) sparingly to enhance the feeling of energy without being distracting.\n\n### 7. Accessibility Considerations\n\n*   **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background elements, especially for body copy. Adhere to WCAG AA standards.\n*   **Readability:** Use appropriate font sizes and line spacing for body text. Ensure interactive elements are clearly identifiable.\n*   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be navigable and usable via keyboard.\n*   **Semantic HTML:** Use semantic HTML5 elements correctly for structure and screen reader compatibility.\n",
