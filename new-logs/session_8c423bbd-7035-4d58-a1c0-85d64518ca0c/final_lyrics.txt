# Final Lyrics: Fizz La Metta

**(Intro - Orchestral swells, building tension, subtle rhythmic pulse)**

**(Verse 1 - SpeedCore beat kicks in, aggressive orchestral stabs, vocals enter)**
(Whispers, building intensity)
Fractured light, a blinding gleam,
A waking nightmare, a fevered dream.
From silent void, a primal call,
Fizz La Metta, consuming all!
Velocity's child, a storm unbound,
Shattering silence, shaking the ground!
A symphony of chaos, sharp and fast,
This fleeting moment, built to last!

**(Chorus 1 - Full orchestral power, intense SpeedCore, anthemic vocals)**
FIZZ LA METTA!
Feel the rush, the sonic blast!
FIZZ LA METTA!
Grandeur shattered, fading fast!
Orchestral fury, digital scream,
Caught in the torrent, a violent stream!
No turning back, no place to hide,
Engulfed by the tide!

**(Breakdown 1 - Abrupt cut, sparse orchestral chords, rebuilding energy)**
(Voice, distorted, echoing)
Echoes... of glory...
Fading... decaying...
(Rhythmic pulse rebuilds)

**(Verse 2 - Similar energy, more dissonant elements, vocals convey struggle)**
Beneath the roar, a hollow sound,
Where broken empires lie profound.
The price of speed, the cost of might,
Consumed by endless, burning light.
A phantom touch, a phantom name,
Igniting ruin, feeding the flame!
Each beat a fracture, a desperate plea,
Lost in the velocity!

**(Chorus 2 - Even more intense, pushed to limits)**
FIZZ LA METTA!
Feel the rush, the sonic blast!
FIZZ LA METTA!
Grandeur shattered, fading fast!
Orchestral fury, digital scream,
Caught in the torrent, a violent stream!
No turning back, no place to hide,
Engulfed by the tide!

**(Bridge - Shift in texture, distorted orchestral solo/spoken word, building tension)**
(Spoken, heavily processed, over heavy, syncopated beat and building orchestral chaos)
They chase the zenith, the ultimate high...
But the fall is infinite, beneath the sky...
This energy... it burns... it breaks... it defines...
Forever bound... by these fractured designs...
(Orchestral build intensifies, drums accelerate)

**(Outro - Massive crescendo, collide, or chaotic fade-out)**
(Full ensemble, extreme distortion, chaotic effects)

**(Option 1: Abrupt End)**

FIZZ!

**(Option 2: Chaotic Fade)**

(Lingering distorted orchestral motifs and decaying SpeedCore beats fade into silence)
