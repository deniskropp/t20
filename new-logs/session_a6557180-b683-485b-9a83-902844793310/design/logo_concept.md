# Logo Concept: "Nexus"

**Description:** A clean, geometric logo representing interconnectedness and a central processing hub. It features interlocking abstract shapes that form a central point, symbolizing the core of the runtime.

**Visual Elements:**

*   A central node or core element.
*   Radiating or interlocking lines/shapes connecting to the core.
*   Uses the primary blue (`#0A2540`) for the core and accent teal (`#1ABC9C`) for the connecting elements.
*   Minimalist and scalable for various sizes.

**Inspiration:** Data flow, network connections, efficient processing.

**Example Sketch (Conceptual):
```
      /---\n     |  O  |
      \---/
     /  |  \
    /   |   \
   *----*----*
```
(Where '*' represents connection points and 'O' the central core)
