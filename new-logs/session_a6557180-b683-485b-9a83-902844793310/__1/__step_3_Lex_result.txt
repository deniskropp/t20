{"output":"The following documentation sections are drafted based on the defined structure and provided inputs:\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\n*   **Purpose and Scope of the Runtime Documentation:**\n    This document provides comprehensive guidance on the runtime system, detailing its architecture, core components, usage, and advanced features. The scope covers the entire lifecycle of the runtime, from initial setup to advanced customization.\n\n*   **Target Audience:**\n    This documentation is intended for software developers, system administrators, and researchers who need to understand, integrate with, or extend the runtime system. A foundational understanding of Python and software development concepts is beneficial.\n\n*   **Overview of Runtime Components:**\n    The runtime system is composed of several key components:\n    *   **Agents:** Individual units of work, each with a specific role and goal, powered by LLMs.\n    *   **Session:** Manages the state and artifacts of a particular workflow execution.\n    *   **ExecutionContext:** Holds the context for a specific step or round within a workflow.\n    *   **Orchestrator:** Responsible for planning and managing the overall workflow.\n    *   **System:** The main class that orchestrates the setup and execution of the entire system.\n    *   **LLM Abstraction:** A layer that allows for integration with various Large Language Models.\n\n**2. Getting Started**\n\n*   **Installation and Setup:**\n    To get started, ensure you have Python installed. The runtime can be installed via pip:\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n    Followed by setting up any necessary environment variables for LLM providers.\n\n*   **Quick Start Guide / Basic Usage Example:**\n    A simple example demonstrating how to run the system:\n    ```bash\n    python -m runtime.sysmain \"Your initial task description\" -r 3 -f file1.txt file2.py\n    ```\n    This command initiates the system with a high-level goal, executes it for 3 rounds, and includes `file1.txt` and `file2.py` as initial inputs.\n\n**3. Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Agents:**\n    Agents are the fundamental building blocks of the runtime. Each agent has a `name`, `role`, `goal`, `model`, and `system_prompt`. They are responsible for executing specific tasks using LLMs. The `Agent` class provides methods for task execution and prompt updates.\n\n*   **Sessions:**\n    The `Session` class manages the lifecycle of a workflow execution. It includes a unique `session_id`, handles artifact storage in a dedicated directory, and maintains a list of agents participating in the session.\n\n*   **ExecutionContext:**\n    The `ExecutionContext` provides the necessary context for an agent to perform its task. It includes the `Session`, the `Plan`, the current `step_index`, `round_num`, and a dictionary of `items` (artifacts) recorded during the workflow.\n\n*   **Plans:**\n    A `Plan` is a structured definition of a workflow, generated by the `Orchestrator`. It includes a `high_level_goal`, `reasoning`, a list of `roles`, and an ordered list of `tasks`. Each `Task` has an `id`, `description`, `role`, `agent`, and a list of `requires` (prerequisite task IDs).\n\n*   **Artifacts:**\n    Artifacts are the outputs generated by agents during task execution. They can be files or other data. The `Session` class manages saving and retrieving artifacts, typically stored within the session's directory.\n\n*   **Workflow Execution Model:**\n    The runtime operates in rounds. Within each round, tasks defined in the `Plan` are executed sequentially by their assigned agents. The `System` class orchestrates this process, managing the `ExecutionContext` and agent interactions.\n\n**4. API Reference**\n\n*   **`runtime.agent.Agent` Class:**\n    *   **`__init__(self, name: str, role: str, goal: str, model: str, system_prompt: str)`:** Initializes an Agent instance.\n    *   **`update_system_prompt(self, new_prompt: str)`:** Updates the agent's system prompt.\n    *   **`execute_task(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> Optional[str]`:** Executes a task based on the provided context.\n    *   **`_run(self, context: ExecutionContext, prompt: str) -> Optional[str]`:** Internal method to run the LLM and process its response.\n\n*   **`runtime.core.Session` Class:**\n    *   **`__init__(self, session_id: str = ..., agents: list = ..., state: str = ..., session_dir: str = ..., project_root: str = ...)`:** Initializes a Session.\n    *   **`add_artifact(self, name: str, content: Any)`:** Saves an artifact to the session directory.\n    *   **`get_artifact(self, name: str) -> Any`:** Loads an artifact from the session directory.\n\n*   **`runtime.core.ExecutionContext` Class:**\n    *   **`__init__(self, session: Session, plan: Plan, step_index: int = 0, round_num: int = 0, items: Dict[str, ContextItem] = field(default_factory=dict))`:** Initializes an ExecutionContext.\n    *   **`next(self)`:** Moves to the next step in the plan.\n    *   **`reset(self)`:** Resets the step index to 0.\n    *   **`current_step(self) -> Task`:** Returns the current task.\n    *   **`record_artifact(self, key: str, value: Any, mem: bool = False)`:** Records an artifact.\n    *   **`record_initial(self, key: str, value: Any)`:** Records an initial artifact.\n\n*   **`runtime.orchestrator.Orchestrator` Class:**\n    *   **`generate_plan(self, session: Session, high_level_goal: str, files: List[File] = []) -> Optional[Plan]`:** Generates a workflow plan.\n\n*   **`runtime.system.System` Class:**\n    *   **`setup(self, orchestrator_name: Optional[str] = None)`:** Sets up the system, loading config and agents.\n    *   **`start(self, high_level_goal: str, files: List[File] = []) -> Plan`:** Starts the workflow by generating a plan.\n    *   **`run(self, plan: Plan, rounds: int = 1, files: List[File] = [])`:** Executes the workflow for a specified number of rounds.\n\n**5. Advanced Usage & Tutorials**\n\n*   **Customizing Agents:**\n    Developers can create custom agent subclasses by inheriting from the `Agent` class and implementing specific logic for task execution or interacting with external services.\n\n*   **Integrating New LLMs:**\n    The `LLM.factory` method allows for easy integration of new LLM providers. To add support for a new LLM, create a new class inheriting from `LLM` and implement the `generate_content` method.\n\n*   **Advanced Planning:**\n    The `Orchestrator` can be customized to generate more sophisticated plans. This might involve modifying the planning prompt or implementing more complex plan validation logic.\n\n**6. Contribution Guide**\n\n*   **Code Standards:**\n    All code should adhere to PEP 8 standards. Docstrings and type hints are mandatory for all functions and classes.\n\n*   **Pull Request Process:**\n    1.  Fork the repository.\n    2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.\n    3.  Make your changes and ensure all tests pass.\n    4.  Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.\n\n**7. Troubleshooting & FAQ**\n\n*   **Q: How do I handle missing LLM API keys?**\n    A: Ensure that the necessary environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) are set before running the system.\n\n*   **Q: What should I do if an agent fails to execute a task?**\n    A: Check the logs for detailed error messages. Ensure the agent's system prompt and the input context are correct. You may need to adjust the LLM parameters or the agent's logic.\n\n*   **Q: How can I debug the workflow execution?**\n    A: Set the logging level to `DEBUG` (`--log-level DEBUG`) to get more verbose output. Examine the artifacts generated at each step for detailed information.","artifact":{"task":"T4","files":[{"path":"docs/runtime/introduction.md","content":"# Introduction\n\n## Purpose and Scope of the Runtime Documentation\n\nThis document provides comprehensive guidance on the runtime system, detailing its architecture, core components, usage, and advanced features.
