{"output":"The generated documentation drafts have been reviewed for accuracy, clarity, completeness, and adherence to project standards. The following feedback is provided for revision:\n\n**1. Introduction:**\n   - **Clarity:** The 'Overview of Runtime Components' could be more concise.

Getting Started:**\n   - **Accuracy:** The installation command `pip install -r requirements.txt` assumes a `requirements.txt` file exists. If this is not guaranteed, suggest `pip install .` or a specific package name if available.\n   - **Clarity:** The example command `python -m runtime.sysmain \"Your initial task description\" -r 3 -f file1.txt file2.py` is good, but it would be beneficial to explain what 'Your initial task description' represents (e.g., a high-level goal).\n\n**3.

I have analyzed the provided documentation drafts (from T4) and identified areas for improvement in terms of accuracy, clarity, completeness, and consistency. I have compiled this feedback into a new Markdown file, `docs/runtime/review_feedback.md`, which details specific suggestions for each section of the documentation. This fulfills the requirements of my sub-task as a Documentation Writer performing a review."}
