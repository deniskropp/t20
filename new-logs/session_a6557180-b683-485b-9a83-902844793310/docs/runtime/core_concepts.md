# Core Concepts

## Agents

Agents are the fundamental building blocks of the runtime. Each agent has a `name`, `role`, `goal`, `model`, and `system_prompt`. They are responsible for executing specific tasks using LLMs. The `Agent` class provides methods for task execution and prompt updates.

## Sessions

The `Session` class manages the lifecycle of a workflow execution. It includes a unique `session_id`, handles artifact storage in a dedicated directory, and maintains a list of agents participating in the session.

## ExecutionContext

The `ExecutionContext` provides the necessary context for an agent to perform its task. It includes the `Session`, the `Plan`, the current `step_index`, `round_num`, and a dictionary of `items` (artifacts) recorded during the workflow.

## Plans

A `Plan` is a structured definition of a workflow, generated by the `Orchestrator`. It includes a `high_level_goal`, `reasoning`, a list of `roles`, and an ordered list of `tasks`. Each `Task` has an `id`, `description`, `role`, `agent`, and a list of `requires` (prerequisite task IDs).

## Artifacts

Artifacts are the outputs generated by agents during task execution. They can be files or other data. The `Session` class manages saving and retrieving artifacts, typically stored within the session's directory.

## Workflow Execution Model

The runtime operates in rounds. Within each round, tasks defined in the `Plan` are executed sequentially by their assigned agents. The `System` class orchestrates this process, managing the `ExecutionContext` and agent interactions.
