# Documentation Review Feedback

This document outlines the feedback provided on the generated documentation drafts to ensure accuracy, clarity, completeness, and adherence to project standards.

## 1. Introduction

*   **Clarity:** The 'Overview of Runtime Components' could be more concise. Consider using a table or a more structured list for better readability.
*   **Completeness:** Ensure the documentation explicitly mentions the role of `runtime.llm.LLM` and its factory pattern for integrating different LLMs.

## 2. Getting Started

*   **Accuracy:** The installation command `pip install -r requirements.txt` assumes a `requirements.txt` file exists. If this is not guaranteed, suggest `pip install .` or a specific package name if available.
*   **Clarity:** The example command `python -m runtime.sysmain "Your initial task description" -r 3 -f file1.txt file2.py` is good, but it would be beneficial to explain what 'Your initial task description' represents (e.g., a high-level goal).

## 3. Core Concepts

*   **Completeness:** Add a brief explanation of the `AgentOutput` Pydantic model and its role in structured agent communication.
*   **Clarity:** The explanation of `ExecutionContext.record_artifact` and `ExecutionContext.record_initial` could be clearer regarding their distinct purposes and when to use each.

## 4. API Reference

*   **Completeness:** The API reference for `runtime.agent.Agent._run` should mention its role in handling LLM interactions and response processing, including JSON parsing and artifact extraction.
*   **Accuracy:** For `runtime.core.Session.add_artifact` and `get_artifact`, specify the expected format of `content` (e.g., string, dict, list) and the file extensions used for different types.
*   **Completeness:** Add the `runtime.custom_types` module to the API reference, detailing models like `Plan`, `Task`, `File`, `Artifact`, `Prompt`, and `Team`.

## 5. Advanced Usage & Tutorials

*   **Completeness:** Expand on 'Advanced Planning' by mentioning how prompt engineering within the `Orchestrator` can influence plan generation.

## 6. Contribution Guide

*   **Completeness:** Add a section on how to run tests.

## 7. Troubleshooting & FAQ

*   **Completeness:** Add a common question about configuring different LLM providers (e.g., setting API keys or endpoints).

## General Feedback

*   **Consistency:** Ensure consistent formatting and terminology throughout the document (e.g., 'LLM' vs. 'Large Language Model').
*   **Examples:** Where possible, add small, illustrative code snippets to clarify concepts, especially in the API Reference and Core Concepts sections.
*   **File Structure:** Mention the typical project structure (e.g., where agent definitions, prompts, and configs are located) in the 'Getting Started' or 'Introduction' section.
