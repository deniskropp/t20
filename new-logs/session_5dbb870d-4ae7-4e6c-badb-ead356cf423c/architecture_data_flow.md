# Tool Architecture and Data Flow Definition

This document outlines the proposed architecture and data flow for weaving a tool from two distinct sources: SYS and TEMPLATE.

## 1. Architecture Overview

The architecture will follow a modular, service-oriented approach, where the SYS and TEMPLATE sources are treated as distinct modules that communicate through well-defined interfaces. A central orchestration layer will manage the interaction and data flow between these sources.

### Core Components:

*   **SYS Source Module:** Encapsulates the functionalities and data inherent to the SYS source. This module will expose an API for interaction.
*   **TEMPLATE Source Module:** Encapsulates the functionalities and data inherent to the TEMPLATE source. This module will also expose an API.
*   **Integration Layer/Orchestration:** This layer acts as the bridge between the SYS and TEMPLATE modules. It will handle:
    *   **Data Transformation:** Converting data formats and structures between the SYS and TEMPLATE sources as defined by the data mapping.
    *   **Request Routing:** Directing requests from the user interface or other components to the appropriate source module.
    *   **Response Aggregation:** Combining responses from different modules if necessary.
*   **User Interface (UI):** The front-end layer that interacts with the user and communicates with the Integration Layer.

## 2. Data Flow

The data flow will be designed to be clear, efficient, and robust.

### Typical Data Flow Scenario (e.g., User Request):

1.  **User Interaction:** A user interacts with the UI, triggering an action.
2.  **UI to Integration Layer:** The UI sends a request to the Integration Layer, specifying the desired action and any necessary input data.
3.  **Integration Layer Processing:**
    *   The Integration Layer determines which source(s) need to be involved based on the request.
    *   If data from the SYS source is needed, it prepares the request and sends it to the **SYS Source Module**.
    *   If data from the TEMPLATE source is needed, it prepares the request and sends it to the **TEMPLATE Source Module**.
    *   **Data Transformation (if required):** Before sending requests to a source module, the Integration Layer may transform input data from the UI format to the source's expected format.
4.  **Source Module Execution:** The respective source module (SYS or TEMPLATE) processes the request and retrieves/manipulates its data.
5.  **Source Module Response:** The source module returns a response to the Integration Layer.
6.  **Data Transformation (if required):** Upon receiving responses, the Integration Layer may transform the data from the source's format into a format suitable for the UI.
7.  **Response Aggregation (if required):** If the request involved multiple sources, the Integration Layer aggregates their responses.
8.  **Integration Layer to UI:** The Integration Layer sends the final, processed response back to the UI.
9.  **UI Rendering:** The UI renders the information to the user.

## 3. Key Considerations for Implementation (Kodax's Role - T6):

*   **API Design:** Define clear and consistent APIs for the SYS and TEMPLATE Source Modules, and for the Integration Layer itself. RESTful APIs or GraphQL can be considered.
*   **Data Mapping Implementation:** The data mapping specifications (from T3) will be directly translated into code within the Integration Layer to handle transformations.
*   **Modularity:** Ensure each component (SYS Module, TEMPLATE Module, Integration Layer) can be developed, tested, and potentially replaced independently.
*   **Performance:** Optimize data retrieval, transformation, and communication pathways to ensure a responsive user experience.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms at each stage of the data flow to gracefully manage failures from either source or within the integration layer.
*   **Scalability:** Design the architecture with future scalability in mind, allowing for increased load or the addition of new sources.

This architecture provides a flexible and maintainable foundation for weaving the tool from the SYS and TEMPLATE sources. The subsequent tasks will involve detailing the specific APIs, data mappings, and implementation logic.
