    "reasoning": "The high-level goal is to 'Weave a tool from two distinct sources: SYS and TEMPLATE source'. This requires a structured approach involving identifying the core components, defining their interactions, and then implementing the tool. The plan will start with extracting task-agnostic steps (TAS) by the TAS extractors, followed by prompt engineering to define agent instructions, design the tool's interface and user experience, engineer the core logic, and finally, integrate and test the tool. The roles of Web Developer, Engineer, and Designer are crucial for the implementation phase, while Prompt Engineer and Coordinator ensure the process is well-defined and managed. The other roles (AI Tutor, Lyricist, Music Designer, Distribution and Promotion Agent) are not directly relevant to the stated high-level goal and will not be assigned tasks in this plan.",
